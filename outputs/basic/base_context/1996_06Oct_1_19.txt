Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the given statement for fallacies. The statement is from a 1996 presidential debate, specifically from someone (probably Al Gore, given the context with Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole) responding to charges about special interest money and environmental laws.

First, I need to parse the statement. The speaker is denying that they opposed efforts to save children from tobacco, and claims that it was Dole and Gingrich who allowed polluters to influence environmental laws. The key part here is the comparison between himself and Dole/Gingrich, implying that they are different in their actions.

Looking at the fallacy categories. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, Slogans. 

The statement seems to be attacking the character of Dole and Gingrich by suggesting they allowed polluters to influence laws, thereby implying that the speaker is better. But wait, the actual fallacy here might be Ad Hominem. Let me think. Ad Hominem is attacking the person rather than the argument. The speaker is not directly attacking the argument but is instead discrediting the opponents by attributing negative actions to them. However, the statement also includes a comparison where the speaker claims that Dole and Gingrich did certain things, while the speaker didn't. This could be a form of Ad Hominem by implying that the opponents are corrupt or influenced by special interests, thus attacking their character. 

Alternatively, is it a False Cause? No, because the statement isn't claiming a causal link between two events. It's more about attributing actions to the opponents. 

Another angle: the speaker is trying to shift blame onto Dole and Gingrich, which is a form of ad hominem by attacking their actions to discredit their positions. The speaker is not addressing the actual issue but instead pointing out the opponents' past actions. This could be a "general ad hominem" where the speaker attacks the opponent's character by suggesting they are corrupt. 

Wait, the statement also says "it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do..." which is a denial of responsibility, but the main point is that the speaker is contrasting their own actions with those of Dole and Gingrich. This is more about discrediting the opponent by association, which is a form of ad hominem. 

So, the classification would be Ad Hominem (2). The subtypes could be general ad hominem or maybe bias ad hominem if the speaker implies the opponents have a bias. But the main fallacy here is attacking the opponents' actions to discredit their positions, which is a general ad hominem. 

Alternatively, could it be a False Cause? No, because there's no causal link being misinterpreted. The speaker is not saying that because X happened, Y must have caused it. 

So, the answer is Ad Hominem (2).
