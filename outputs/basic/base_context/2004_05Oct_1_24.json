    "analysis": "The statement references George Tenet, a high-ranking authority (CIA director), to support the claim about Iraq's connection to terrorists. However, the argument relies on the authority's position without providing specific evidence from Tenet's testimony. This is an appeal to authority (1) because the speaker uses the credibility of the authority figure to validate the claim rather than presenting substantive evidence. The context suggests the speaker is leveraging Tenet's role to imply legitimacy, which aligns with the fallacy of appealing to an authority's status rather than the merits of the argument itself.",
