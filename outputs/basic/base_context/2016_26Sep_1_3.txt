Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is from a 2016 presidential debate, and I need to figure out what fallacy it's using. The statement is: "And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton."

First, I should break down the statement. The speaker is talking about leadership being necessary to get funds into the country, which can then be used for inner cities and other projects. Then they say they have no leadership and blame Secretary Clinton for that.

Looking at the categories provided, let's consider each one. 

Appeal to Emotion (0): The statement uses emotional language like "beautiful" and mentions inner cities, which might evoke sympathy, but I'm not sure if that's the main fallacy here. The emotional aspect might be present, but the main point seems to be about leadership.

Appeal to Authority (1): The speaker mentions Secretary Clinton as a leader, but they're not citing an authority figure's opinion. Instead, they're blaming her for the lack of leadership. So maybe not Appeal to Authority.

Ad Hominem (2): This involves attacking the person rather than the argument. The speaker says "that starts with Secretary Clinton," implying she's responsible for the lack of leadership. That sounds like an attack on her character or position, which could be a general ad hominem. Alternatively, it could be a bias ad hominem if they suggest she's personally benefiting, but the statement doesn't mention that. It's more about her being the source of the problem, which is a personal attack. So this might be Ad Hominem.

False Cause (3): This is about assuming causation from correlation. The statement doesn't really link two events as cause and effect, so maybe not.

Slippery Slope (4): The statement doesn't mention a series of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. It's more about current leadership issues, not a chain of events.

Slogans (5): The statement isn't a catchy phrase or repetition. It's more of a direct accusation.

So the main fallacy here seems to be Ad Hominem, specifically the general ad hominem where the speaker attacks the person (Secretary Clinton) instead of addressing the argument about leadership. The speaker is not providing evidence for the lack of leadership but is blaming Clinton, which is an attack on her character or position. Therefore, the classification should be 2.
