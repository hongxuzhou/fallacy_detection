    "analysis": "The statement references criticisms of the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal by George Bush and Business Week to argue against its merits. This relies on the authority of these figures/publication to discredit the proposal without providing direct evidence of its flaws. By citing their opinions as justification, the speaker appeals to their perceived authority rather than engaging with the proposal's actual merits, fitting the definition of an Appeal to Authority.",
