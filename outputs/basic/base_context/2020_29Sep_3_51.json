{
    "analysis": "The statement 'It's a racist place' functions as a label applied to an opposing viewpoint, which is a form of name-calling. By attributing the opposing argument to racism, the speaker attacks the character or motives of the opposing side rather than addressing the argument itself. This aligns with the 'Name-calling, Labeling' sub-type of ad hominem fallacy, as it uses an offensive label to dismiss the opposing position rather than engaging with its merits.",
