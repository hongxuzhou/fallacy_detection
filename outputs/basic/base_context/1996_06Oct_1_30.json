    "analysis": "The statement is a question directed at the audience, asking if they are better off than four years ago. While it is framed as a direct inquiry, the context suggests the speaker is shifting focus from their own claims of being better off to the audience's personal experiences. This rhetorical tactic aims to evoke an emotional response by engaging the audience's self-interest and personal circumstances, aligning with the 'flag waving' subcategory of Appeal to Emotion, which appeals to group identity by referencing the audience's shared experience. The phrasing does not contain overtly emotional language, but the intent is to connect with the audience's emotional state through their perceived personal situation.",
