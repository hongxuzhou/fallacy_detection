    "analysis": "The statement presents a comparison of price increases between two administrations without providing evidence or context for the data. By asserting 'We find that...' without citing sources or methodologies, the speaker implicitly appeals to an authority or authority figure (possibly an unseen expert or institution) to validate the claim. This aligns with Appeal to Authority (1), as the argument relies on the credibility of an unspecified authority rather than substantive evidence.",
