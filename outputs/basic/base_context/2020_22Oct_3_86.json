    "analysis": "The statement 'We're dying with it, because he's never said \u2014 he said it's dangerous' contains a causal link between the absence of a statement (not saying it's dangerous) and the outcome (people dying). This is a misinterpretation of correlation as causation, as the speaker assumes that the lack of a statement directly leads to the consequence without providing evidence. This fits the definition of a False Cause fallacy (3), where an unlikely causal connection is implied without justification.",
