    "analysis": "The statement 'Our character is on the ballot' is a concise, memorable phrase designed to provoke emotional resonance by emphasizing the importance of personal integrity in the election. While it touches on emotional themes (e.g., honor, truth), the primary function is to serve as a rallying slogan that simplifies the argument and appeals to the audience's values. It does not directly attack the opponent, rely on authority, or misrepresent causation. The key feature is its brevity and emotional impact, aligning with the 'Slogans' category.",
