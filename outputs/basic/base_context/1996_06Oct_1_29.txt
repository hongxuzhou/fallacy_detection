Okay, let's tackle this fallacy classification. The statement in question is: "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." The date is 1996-10-06, so it's from a presidential debate. The context mentions a tax scheme and references Senator Dole's campaign co-chair, D'Amato, who says he has to cut Medicare to pay for it. The speaker is arguing against this tax scheme, citing economists and Nobel laureates.

First, I need to recall the fallacy categories. The options are Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), Ad Hominem (2), False Cause (3), Slippery Slope (4), and Slogans (5). 

The statement mentions 500 economists and seven Nobel Prize winners. This seems like an appeal to authority because it's citing experts in the field. However, I need to check if there's a misuse here. Appeal to Authority is when someone cites an authority without relevant evidence or uses non-experts. But here, the economists and Nobel laureates are relevant experts in economics. However, the phrase "everybody who's looked at it" might be a way to overstate the consensus. But the main point is that the speaker is using the authority of these experts to support the claim. 

Wait, but the statement is not just citing an authority; it's using the fact that many experts agree. That's a common fallacy called "appeal to authority" if the argument is based solely on the authority's opinion without evidence. However, in this case, the speaker is using the consensus of experts. But is that a fallacy? Or is it a valid use of authority? 

Wait, the definition of Appeal to Authority is when the arguer mentions an authority or group without providing relevant evidence, or mentions non-experts. Here, the speaker is citing economists and Nobel winners, who are experts. So maybe this is not a fallacy. But the problem might be that the speaker is not providing evidence, just citing the experts. But the statement is part of a larger argument where the speaker is trying to say that the tax scheme is bad because experts say so. So is this an appeal to authority?

Alternatively, could it be a false cause? No, because the statement isn't about causation. The statement is about the opinion of experts. So maybe Appeal to Authority. But wait, sometimes citing experts can be a valid argument, so maybe it's not a fallacy. But the question is about fallacious statements. So maybe the fallacy here is Appeal to Authority because the speaker is relying on the authority of economists and Nobel winners without providing evidence, but actually, the statement is using their opinion as the evidence. Wait, but if the argument is that the experts say it's bad, then that's a form of appeal to authority. However, if the experts are relevant, then it's not necessarily a fallacy. But the question is about fallacious statements. 

Wait, the original statement is part of a political argument. The speaker is trying to argue that the tax scheme is bad because experts say so. But if the speaker is not providing any evidence beyond the experts' opinions, that's an appeal to authority. However, in some contexts, citing experts can be valid. But in the context of a political debate, it's possible that the speaker is using the authority of the experts without providing any actual evidence or reasoning. So this would be an appeal to authority. 

But another angle: the statement says "everybody who's looked at it" which might be an overstatement, but the main point is the mention of the experts. So the classification would be Appeal to Authority (1). 

Alternatively, could it be a false cause? No, because there's no causation mentioned. It's about the experts' opinion. 

Another possibility: the speaker is using the fact that many economists agree, which is a form of appeal to popularity (which is a subset of appeal to authority?), but the options don't have appeal to popularity. The options for appeal to authority include "mentioning popular non-experts or the acceptance of the claim by the majority." Wait, the definition of Appeal to Authority is when the arguer mentions the name of an authority or a group of people who agreed with her claim either without providing any relevant evidence, or by mentioning popular non-experts, or the acceptance of the claim by the majority. 

So here, the speaker is citing 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates, which are experts, but the argument is that their agreement is the basis for the claim. However, if the speaker is not providing any evidence beyond their agreement, that's an appeal to authority. But if the experts are relevant, then it's not necessarily a fallacy. However, in the context of a political debate, the speaker might be using the authority of the experts to sway the audience without presenting actual evidence, which would make it an appeal to authority. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to authority because the argument is based on the opinion of experts without further evidence. So the classification would be 1 (Appeal to Authority). 

Another thought: sometimes, when someone cites a large number of experts, it's a form of appeal to authority. So the answer is Appeal to Authority (1). 

But wait, the statement is "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." The mention of the number of economists and Nobel laureates could be an attempt to create an illusion of consensus, which is a form of appeal to authority. So the classification is 1.
