Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." The date is 2000-10-03, and the context is from a presidential debate. The context mentions Social Security, revenues exceeding expenses until 2015, and the speaker is addressing people who might be scared into voting for the opponent. The statement is in the middle of that.

First, I need to figure out what kind of fallacy this is. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans. 

Looking at the statement itself: "A promise made will be a promise kept." That sounds like a general principle or a slogan. But how does it fit into the context? The speaker is talking about Social Security promises and trying to reassure voters that retirees will get their promises. The statement seems to be a moral or ethical assertion, maybe intended to evoke trust or emotional response. 

Wait, but the context also mentions that the opponent (the vice president) thinks the money is the government's. The speaker is arguing that younger workers should take their own money, implying that the current system's promises are reliable. The statement might be an appeal to emotion by emphasizing the reliability of promises, perhaps to make people feel secure. However, the statement itself is a general principle. 

Alternatively, could this be a slogan? Slogans are brief, striking phrases meant to provoke excitement. "A promise made will be a promise kept" is a common saying, maybe used as a slogan to rally support. But the context here is more about Social Security, so maybe the speaker is using it to appeal to the audience's sense of trust and reliability, which could be an appeal to emotion. 

Wait, but the original statement is a general principle. The fallacy here might not be a direct appeal to emotion. Let me check the categories again. Appeal to Emotion includes loaded language, flag waving, etc. The statement isn't using loaded language, but maybe it's trying to evoke trust, which is a form of emotional appeal. However, the statement itself is a general assertion. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause? If the speaker is implying that because promises are made, they will be kept, perhaps without evidence. But the statement is more of a moral assertion rather than a causal link. 

Wait, the statement is presented as a universal truth, which might be a false cause if it's being used to justify a policy. But the context is about Social Security, and the speaker is arguing that the promises will be kept. However, the actual fallacy might be in the way the argument is structured. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a slogan (category 5). Slogans are brief and striking. The statement is a common saying, and in the context, it's used to make a point about keeping promises, possibly to sway the audience emotionally. 

But the speaker is also contrasting with the vice president's view. The statement could be part of an appeal to emotion by emphasizing the reliability of promises, making the audience feel secure. However, the statement itself is not necessarily emotional language but a moral principle. 

Wait, maybe the fallacy here is Appeal to Emotion (0) through loaded language. But the statement is a simple assertion. Alternatively, maybe it's not a fallacy at all, but the question says to classify it. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause (3) if the speaker is assuming that because promises are made, they will be kept, which might not be the case. But the statement itself is a general rule, not necessarily a causal link. 

Hmm. The statement is a general principle, but in the context, it's used to support the argument that retirees will get their promises. The speaker is arguing that the current system's promises are reliable, so the statement is a moral assertion. However, the fallacy might be in the way it's used. 

Alternatively, the statement is a slogan (category 5) because it's a catchy phrase meant to provoke a reaction. The context includes the statement as a way to make a point, so it's used to rally support. 

But the original statement is presented as a general truth, not necessarily a slogan. However, in the context, it's used to make an emotional appeal. 

Wait, the user's options for Appeal to Emotion include "loaded language" and "flag waving." The statement "A promise made will be a promise kept" is a moral assertion, not necessarily loaded language. But maybe the speaker is using it to evoke trust and emotional response, making it an appeal to emotion. 

Alternatively, it's not a fallacy. But the task is to classify it. Given the options, I think the best fit might be Appeal to Emotion (0) as it's using a moral principle to evoke trust. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a slogan (5). 

Wait, the statement is a common saying, which is a slogan. For example, in politics, slogans are used to make a point. So the classification might be 5. But the context is more about the Social Security promises, so the statement is used as a slogan to make the argument. 

Alternatively, maybe it's not a fallacy. But the question says to classify it as one of the fallacies. 

Wait, the statement itself is not a fallacy, but the way it's used in the context might be. Let me check again. The speaker is saying that the promises will be kept, which is a general statement. If the speaker is using this to argue that the Social Security system is reliable, but the actual reasoning might be flawed. However, the statement itself is not a fallacy. 

Alternatively, the fallacy might be in the context. The speaker is trying to reassure voters that the promises will be kept, which could be an appeal to emotion by making people feel secure. But the statement itself is a general principle. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me look at the options again. 

Appeal to Emotion (0) includes loaded language. The statement "A promise made will be a promise kept" is a moral principle, not loaded language. 

Appeal to Authority (1) is about citing authorities. Not applicable here. 

Ad Hominem (2) is attacking the person. Not here. 

False Cause (3) is about correlation vs causation. Not here. 

Slippery Slope (4) is about exaggerated outcomes. Not here. 

Slogans (5) are brief phrases to provoke excitement. The statement is a slogan. 

So maybe the answer is 5. But the statement is a general principle, not a slogan. However, in the context, it's used as a way to make a point, possibly as a slogan to rally support. 

Alternatively, the statement is a general principle and not a fallacy. But the task is to classify it as one of the fallacies. 

Wait, the statement is part of the argument. The speaker is using it to argue that retirees will get their promises. The fallacy here might be that the speaker is assuming that the promises will be kept without evidence, which could be a false cause. But the statement is a general assertion. 

Alternatively, the statement is a slogan (5) because it's a catchy phrase used to make a point. 

I think the answer is 5, Slogans. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, Appeal to Emotion (0) if it's meant to evoke trust. 

But the statement itself is a moral principle, not necessarily emotional language. So maybe it's not an appeal to emotion. 

Hmm. Given the options, I think the best fit is Slogans (5) because it's a brief, striking phrase used to make a point. The context uses it to emphasize the reliability of promises, which is a slogan-like statement. 

So the classification is 5.
