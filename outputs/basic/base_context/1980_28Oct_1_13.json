    "analysis": "The statement criticizes Carter's policy by pointing out a contradiction between his previous promise and his later actions. While it highlights a policy inconsistency, the argument does not directly attack Carter's character or credibility. Instead, it implies that Carter's actions are hypocritical, which falls under the general ad hominem category by undermining his credibility through inconsistency rather than attacking his personal traits. However, the core argument is not a fallacy but a factual critique. Given the options, the closest classification is Ad Hominem (2) as it involves attacking the opponent's consistency rather than their character directly.",
