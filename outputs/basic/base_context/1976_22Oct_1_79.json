    "analysis": "The statement presents a comparison of inflation rates between different administrations, but it does not explicitly commit a fallacy in the data itself. However, the broader context includes emotional appeals (e.g., 'robbing us') and attacks on Ford's inaction, which align with ad hominem (2) or appeal to emotion (0). The statement itself, however, is a factual claim about economic data. Since the question focuses on the statement's content, and no clear fallacy is present in the data comparison, the closest classification is False Cause (3), as it may imply a causal link between the current administration and inflation without sufficient evidence.",
