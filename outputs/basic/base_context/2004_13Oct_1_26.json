    "analysis": "The statement uses the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as a source to support the claim about Social Security deficits. However, the context includes emotionally charged language like 'invitation to disaster' and emphasizes the consequences of inaction, which appeals to fear. While the CBO's report is cited as evidence, the broader argument relies on evoking emotional responses (fear of financial disaster) to sway the audience, making it an appeal to emotion. The mention of the CBO is legitimate, but the emotional framing dominates the argument.",
