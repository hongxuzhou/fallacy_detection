    "analysis": "The statement invokes Abraham Lincoln as an authority to argue against Bob Dole's position on affirmative action. However, Lincoln's historical stance on affirmative action is not directly relevant or evidence-based. The speaker assumes Lincoln's hypothetical agreement with their position without providing substantive evidence, which misuses Lincoln's historical authority to bolster the argument. This falls under 'Appeal to Authority' as the arguer cites a non-expert (Lincoln) on the topic to lend credibility to their claim.",
