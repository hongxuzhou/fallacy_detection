    "analysis": "The statement cites a past president's quote to support the argument, implying credibility through association with an authority figure. While the quote itself is a historical reference, the speaker uses Kennedy's authority to bolster their claim without providing additional evidence linking the quote to the current argument's validity. This aligns with Appeal to Authority, as the argument relies on the authority of the cited figure rather than substantive evidence.",
