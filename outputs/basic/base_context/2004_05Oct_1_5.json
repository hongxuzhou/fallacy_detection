    "analysis": "The statement 'They were with the drug companies.' is part of a rhetorical strategy that frames the opposing side's alignment with corporate interests as a personal bias. By asserting that the opposing side prioritized drug companies over the American people, the speaker attacks the opponent's motives (implying self-interest) rather than engaging with the actual policy arguments. This aligns with the 'bias ad hominem' sub-type, where the arguer suggests the opponent's stance is driven by personal gain rather than objective reasoning.",
