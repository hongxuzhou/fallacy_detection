    "analysis": "The statement attempts to attribute the success of maintaining price stability to the formation of the committee, implying a causal relationship without providing evidence. This is a classic example of False Cause (3), where a correlation between the committee's formation and price stability is mistakenly interpreted as causation. The speaker avoids taking direct credit but still asserts the committee's effectiveness, which relies on an unproven causal link.",
