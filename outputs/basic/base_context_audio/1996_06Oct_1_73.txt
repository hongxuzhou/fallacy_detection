Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify the given statement into a fallacy category. The statement is from a 1996 presidential debate, specifically from the context provided.

First, I need to understand the statement. The speaker is talking about a tax scheme and mentions that even the campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says they'd have to cut Medicare more than the bill the speaker vetoed. The speaker is arguing against the tax scheme because it would lead to more Medicare cuts.

Now, looking at the fallacy categories. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, Slogans. 

Let me break down the statement. The key part here is the mention of Senator D'Amato. The speaker is using D'Amato's position to support their argument. But wait, is D'Amato an authority on Medicare? The statement says that D'Amato, as a campaign co-chair, says they'd have to cut Medicare more. But the speaker is using this to imply that the tax scheme is bad because even someone associated with the opponent's campaign (assuming D'Amato is from the other party) says it would lead to more cuts. 

Wait, but the speaker is not necessarily attacking D'Amato's character. They're citing D'Amato's statement. However, if the speaker is using the authority of D'Amato without proper evidence, that might be an Appeal to Authority. But D'Amato is a senator, so maybe he's an authority. But the speaker is using his statement as a reason to oppose the tax scheme. But is there a fallacy here?

Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause. The speaker is connecting the tax scheme passing to Medicare cuts. But the statement says that if the tax scheme passes, then even D'Amato says they have to cut Medicare more. However, the speaker is implying that the tax scheme would lead to more cuts, which is a causal link. But is that a false cause? Or is it a slippery slope? 

Wait, the statement is not necessarily saying that the tax scheme will definitely lead to more cuts, but that even D'Amato says that. But the speaker is using D'Amato's statement as a reason to oppose the tax scheme. However, the speaker is not necessarily making a causal link between the tax scheme and Medicare cuts. Instead, they're using D'Amato's statement as a reason. 

Wait, but maybe the fallacy here is Appeal to Authority. The speaker is citing an authority (D'Amato) to support their claim. But D'Amato is a campaign co-chair, not necessarily an expert on Medicare. However, he's a senator, so maybe he's an authority. But the problem is that the speaker is using D'Amato's statement without providing evidence that the tax scheme would indeed lead to those cuts. So maybe it's an Appeal to Authority. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause. The speaker is suggesting that the tax scheme would lead to Medicare cuts because D'Amato says so. But that's not a direct cause. Wait, the statement is "if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed." Wait, the structure here is a bit confusing. The speaker is saying that if the tax scheme passes, then Medicare cuts would be even more. But the reason given is that D'Amato says so. So the speaker is using D'Amato's statement as the reason for the tax scheme leading to cuts. 

But maybe the fallacy here is Appeal to Authority. The speaker is using the authority of D'Amato to support the claim that the tax scheme would lead to more cuts. However, the speaker is not necessarily saying that D'Amato is an expert, but rather that his statement is a reason to oppose the tax scheme. Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause, where the speaker is assuming that because D'Amato says it, the tax scheme will lead to cuts. But that's not a causal link. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an Ad Hominem. Wait, the speaker is attacking the opponent's campaign co-chair, but the statement is about the tax scheme. Wait, the speaker is not attacking D'Amato's character but using his statement. So maybe not Ad Hominem. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a Slippery Slope. The speaker is suggesting that if the tax scheme passes, it will lead to more Medicare cuts. But the statement doesn't mention a series of steps leading to an exaggerated outcome. It's more of a direct claim. 

Wait, the original statement is: "But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed." 

So the speaker is arguing that the tax scheme would lead to more Medicare cuts because D'Amato says so. The fallacy here is that the speaker is using D'Amato's statement as a reason, but D'Amato is not necessarily an authority on this matter. The speaker is using the authority of D'Amato (who is part of the opponent's campaign) to support the claim. This might be an Appeal to Authority, but if D'Amato is not an expert, then it's a fallacy. However, D'Amato is a senator, so maybe he's an authority. 

Alternatively, maybe the speaker is using the fact that D'Amato, who is part of the opponent's campaign, is saying that the tax scheme would lead to more cuts, which is an appeal to authority. But if the speaker is using D'Amato's authority without evidence, then it's an Appeal to Authority. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause. The speaker is assuming that because D'Amato says it, the tax scheme will cause Medicare cuts. But that's not a causal link. The speaker is using the statement of an authority to support the claim, which is an Appeal to Authority. 

Wait, the statement is not making a causal link between the tax scheme and Medicare cuts, but rather using D'Amato's statement as a reason. So the fallacy is Appeal to Authority. 

But another angle: the speaker is using the fact that D'Amato, who is part of the opponent's campaign, says that the tax scheme would lead to more cuts. This might be an Appeal to Authority, but if the speaker is not providing evidence that the tax scheme actually leads to cuts, just citing D'Amato's statement, then it's an Appeal to Authority. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause because the speaker is implying that the tax scheme causes Medicare cuts based on D'Amato's statement. But the speaker is not making a direct causal link. 

Hmm. I think the main fallacy here is Appeal to Authority (1), because the speaker is citing the authority of Senator D'Amato to support the claim that the tax scheme would lead to more Medicare cuts. However, the speaker might be using the authority of D'Amato, who is a campaign co-chair, not necessarily an expert on Medicare. So, the fallacy is Appeal to Authority. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause, but I think the primary fallacy here is Appeal to Authority. 

Wait, the statement says that even D'Amato says they'll have to cut Medicare more. The speaker is using D'Amato's statement as a reason to oppose the tax scheme. So the speaker is relying on D'Amato's authority. So this is an Appeal to Authority. Therefore, the classification would be 1.
