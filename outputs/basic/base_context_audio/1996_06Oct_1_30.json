    "analysis": "The statement directly addresses the audience with a rhetorical question, aiming to provoke an emotional response by personalizing the issue of economic well-being. The speaker's emotional tone (high arousal, dominance, valence) suggests an attempt to engage viewers' personal experiences and evoke a sense of shared struggle or optimism. This aligns with the 'Appeal to Emotion' category, specifically using emotional engagement to influence perception rather than presenting factual evidence.",
