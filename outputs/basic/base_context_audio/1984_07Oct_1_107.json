    "analysis": "The statement references President Kennedy's past quote to support the argument that progress is possible. While citing a historical figure's words, the speaker is leveraging Kennedy's authority (as a former president) to imply credibility for their own claim. This aligns with Appeal to Authority (1), as the argument relies on the perceived authority of Kennedy without providing direct evidence for the specific claim about the future. The quote itself is not inherently fallacious, but its use here serves to bolster the argument through association with a respected figure.",
