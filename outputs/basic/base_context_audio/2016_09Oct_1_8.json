    "analysis": "The statement 'So you really owe him an apology' is directed at the opponent's past actions (sending controversial pictures) and demands accountability. This is an attack on the opponent's behavior, fitting the 'general ad hominem' subtype, which targets the person's character or actions rather than addressing the argument itself. The emotional context of the Khan family's loss is used to pressure the opponent, but the core fallacy lies in attacking the individual's conduct to discredit their position.",
