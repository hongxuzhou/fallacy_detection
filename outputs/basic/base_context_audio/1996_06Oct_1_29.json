    "analysis": "The statement cites the opinions of 500 economists and seven Nobel Prize winners as evidence that a policy is bad for the economy.

The speaker uses their credentials to bolster the argument, which is a classic example of appealing to authority by referencing experts without establishing a causal link or providing evidence of their specific analysis.",
