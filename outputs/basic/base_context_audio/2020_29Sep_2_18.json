    "analysis": "The statement 'You don't have it in your blood' is a personal attack targeting Joe's inherent qualities or character, rather than addressing the substantive argument. By implying Joe lacks the necessary traits ('blood') to perform the job, the speaker shifts focus from the issue at hand to an attack on Joe's identity or capabilities. This aligns with the **general ad hominem** fallacy, which involves undermining an opponent's character or inherent attributes to dismiss their argument.",
