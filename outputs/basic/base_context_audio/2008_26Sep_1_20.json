    "analysis": "The statement cites Admiral Mullen, a military authority, to support the claim that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous. This relies on the authority of a figure without providing independent evidence, fitting the definition of an Appeal to Authority (1). The speaker uses Mullen's position to lend credibility to their argument, even though the subsequent context suggests the speaker is refuting this claim. The fallacy lies in the initial reliance on authority rather than substantive reasoning.",
