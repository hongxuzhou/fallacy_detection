Okay, let's tackle this fallacy analysis. The statement in question is from a 1992 presidential debate. The speaker mentions that "9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans" support their economic ideas. 

First, I need to recall the fallacy categories provided. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, and Slogans. 

Looking at the statement, the speaker is citing a large number of experts (Nobel laureates, economists, business people) to back their argument. This seems like an appeal to authority because they're using the credibility of these experts to support their claim. However, I should check if there's any other possible fallacy here. 

Wait, the key here is whether the speaker is actually providing relevant evidence or just using the authority. The statement doesn't mention any specific evidence or studies, just the number of people endorsing the idea. That's a classic appeal to authority fallacy. The speaker is not providing the actual arguments or data but is relying on the number of experts to validate their position. 

Is there a chance it's another fallacy? Maybe appeal to emotion? The statement doesn't use emotional language, just facts about the number of people. The context mentions the speaker's tone is energetic and positive, but the statement itself is more about citing experts. 

No, the main issue here is the reliance on the authority of the experts rather than substantive evidence. So the classification should be Appeal to Authority (1). 

I should also check if it's a false cause or something else. False cause is about correlation vs. causation, which isn't present here. Slippery slope is about a chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome, which isn't the case. The statement doesn't use a slogan either, though the phrasing is a bit catchy, but the main point is the authority. 

Therefore, the correct classification is Appeal to Authority (1).
