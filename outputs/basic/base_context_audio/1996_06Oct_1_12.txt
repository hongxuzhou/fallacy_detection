Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify the given statement into a specific fallacy category. The statement is from a 1996 presidential debate, so the context is political. Let me read the statement again: "I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill."

First, I need to understand the statement's content. The speaker is talking about supporting a bill, but then says that members of Dole's own party in the Senate killed it. Also, Dole wasn't urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. 

Now, looking at the fallacy categories. Let's go through each one. 

Appeal to Emotion (0) involves emotional language. The statement here doesn't seem to use emotional language like loaded terms or fear/pity. It's more about accusing the opponent's party of not supporting the bill. So maybe not 0.

Appeal to Authority (1) would involve citing an authority. The speaker mentions Senator Dole and others, but is that an appeal to authority? The statement is more about the actions of Dole's party rather than citing an expert. Not sure yet, maybe not 1.

Ad Hominem (2) involves attacking the person. The statement says Dole wasn't urging his party members to support the bill. Is that attacking Dole's character or his actions? It's pointing out his lack of support, which could be a personal attack. But the subtypes are general ad hominem (attack on character), tu quoque (you did it first), or bias. Alternatively, maybe it's a tu quoque if they're saying he didn't support it, implying he's hypocritical. Or maybe it's a personal attack on his actions. Wait, the statement is not directly attacking Dole's character but pointing out his inaction. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's not ad hominem. Let me think again.

False Cause (3) is about assuming causation from correlation. The statement doesn't seem to link two events as cause and effect. The speaker is saying that Dole's party members killed the bill, but that's more about responsibility rather than a causal link. Not sure if this is false cause.

Slippery Slope (4) suggests an unlikely outcome. The statement doesn't talk about a chain of events leading to an exaggerated result. So probably not 4.

Slogans (5) are brief phrases to provoke. The statement isn't a slogan but a statement of fact or accusation. So not 5.

Wait, maybe it's ad hominem. The speaker is saying that Dole didn't support the bill, implying that he's not a good leader or that his party is not supporting it. But the original statement is about the party members killing the bill, not directly attacking Dole's character. However, the part where it says "he was not out there urging them" could be an ad hominem tu quoque, suggesting that Dole didn't support it, so he's not credible. Alternatively, it's a personal attack on Dole's actions, which might be a bias ad hominem if implying he benefits from not supporting it. But the statement doesn't mention any personal gain. 

Alternatively, maybe it's not a fallacy. Wait, the statement is making an argument that the bill was killed by Dole's party, and that Dole didn't support it. That's a factual claim. But is there a fallacy here? Maybe not. Unless the speaker is attacking Dole's character by implying that he's not a good leader because he didn't support the bill. But the original statement is more about the party's actions rather than attacking Dole's character. 

Wait, the statement is "members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill." So the speaker is saying that Dole's party members killed the bill, and Dole didn't push for it. That's an attack on Dole's effectiveness or leadership. That could be an ad hominem (general) because it's attacking Dole's character as a leader. Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause if the speaker is implying that Dole's party killed the bill because of his influence. But the statement is more about the party's actions. 

Wait, the original statement is part of a larger context where the speaker is advocating for campaign reform. The statement is pointing out that Dole's party killed the bill, and Dole didn't support it. The speaker might be trying to discredit Dole by suggesting that he's not in favor of the bill, which is part of the campaign reform. This could be an ad hominem attack on Dole's position, implying that he's not a good leader because he doesn't support the bill. That would be a general ad hominem. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause if the speaker is implying that Dole's party killed the bill because of Dole's influence. But that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe it's not a fallacy. The speaker is making a factual claim about Dole's actions. But if the speaker is attacking Dole's character by saying he didn't support the bill, that's an ad hominem. 

Hmm. The key here is whether the statement is attacking the person's character or making a factual claim. If the speaker is saying that Dole didn't support the bill, that's a factual claim. But if the speaker is using that to discredit Dole's overall position or character, that's an ad hominem. 

In the context, the speaker is arguing that the bill was killed by Dole's party and that Dole didn't support it. The implication is that Dole's party is not supportive of the bill, which is part of the campaign reform. The speaker is trying to argue that the bill should be passed, and by pointing out that Dole's party killed it, they're trying to show that the opposition is not in favor. However, the specific part about Dole not urging them to vote for the bill could be an ad hominem. If the speaker is implying that Dole is not a good leader because he didn't support the bill, that's attacking his character. 

But the original statement is "he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill." So the speaker is saying that Dole didn't push for the bill. That's a factual statement, but in a political context, it's a way to attack Dole's effectiveness. So this could be an ad hominem (general) because it's attacking Dole's character as a leader who doesn't support the bill. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause if the speaker is assuming that Dole's inaction caused the bill's failure. But the statement is more about the party members' actions, not directly about Dole's influence. 

Wait, the statement is saying that the members of Dole's party killed the bill, and Dole wasn't urging them. So the speaker is implying that Dole is responsible for the party's actions, even though he didn't directly urge them. That could be an ad hominem, as the speaker is attributing the party's actions to Dole, thereby attacking his character. 

So, considering the options, the best fit is Ad Hominem (2). The speaker is attacking Dole's actions or character by implying that he's not supporting the bill, which is part of the ad hominem. The classification would be 2.
