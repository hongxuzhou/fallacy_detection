    "analysis": "The statement directly attacks the opponent's character by labeling them as 'all talk and no action,' which is a form of name-calling. This personal attack undermines the argument by focusing on the individual's perceived lack of action rather than addressing the actual policy or evidence. The emotional tone of the speaker may amplify the impact of the attack, but the core fallacy lies in the ad hominem tactic of discrediting the opponent through derogatory labeling.",
