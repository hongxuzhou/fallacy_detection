Okay, let's tackle this fallacy analysis. The statement in question is from a 1984 presidential debate. The speaker is talking about the dangers of delegating war decisions to computers. The specific statement is: "There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go."

First, I need to understand the context. The speaker is arguing against a proposal that involves computers making decisions about starting a war. They're concerned about the risks of such a system. The statement is part of a larger argument where they're warning about the dangers of computerized decision-making in warfare.

Now, looking at the possible fallacies. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans. Let's break down the statement. The speaker is using examples like an oil fire or jet exhaust being misidentified as missiles. This seems to be an attempt to evoke fear. The idea is that the computer could make a wrong decision, leading to a catastrophic outcome. The speaker is trying to make the audience feel anxious about the possibility of a computer error leading to war. 

This seems like an appeal to emotion, specifically the appeal to fear. The speaker is not providing evidence of the computer's unreliability but is instead highlighting the potential for a scary scenario. The emotional language here is meant to provoke fear in the audience, making them agree with the speaker's position without solid evidence. 

Looking at the subcategories of Appeal to Emotion: appeal to fear is one of them. The statement is using hypothetical scenarios that could cause fear, implying that the consequences of delegating to computers are dire. There's no direct attack on the opponent's character (so not Ad Hominem), no appeal to an authority (since they're not citing an expert), no false cause (they aren't saying that because of X, Y happens), and it's not a slogan. The statement isn't a catchy phrase but rather a specific argument. 

So, the classification here would be Appeal to Emotion, specifically appeal to fear. Therefore, the number is 0.
