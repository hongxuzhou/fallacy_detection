    "analysis": "The statement warns that allowing government intervention in labor disputes will inevitably lead to wage and price controls, implying a direct causal relationship without providing evidence for this connection. This misrepresents a correlation between government involvement and undesirable outcomes as a necessary causal chain, fitting the definition of a False Cause fallacy. The speaker assumes that any government intervention will result in extreme measures (wage/price control) without addressing intermediate steps or alternative outcomes.",
