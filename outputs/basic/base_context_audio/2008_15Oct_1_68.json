    "analysis": "The statement attributes the housing crisis solely to Fannie and Freddie Mae's role in subprime lending, implying a direct causal link.

By asserting a single cause without acknowledging other contributing elements, the argument misrepresents the causal relationship, which is a classic example of the False Cause fallacy.",
