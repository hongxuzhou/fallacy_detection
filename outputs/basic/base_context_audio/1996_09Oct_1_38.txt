Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is: "With all due respect, I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to end all affirmative action." The context mentions that the speaker is talking about a specific measure in California, introduced by Dole, and that Kemp opposed it but now endorses it. The speaker is contrasting Lincoln's beliefs with Dole's position.

First, I need to figure out the fallacy type. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans. 

Looking at the statement, the speaker is using Abraham Lincoln as a reference. The idea here is that if Lincoln, a revered historical figure, wouldn't support Dole's position, then that position must be wrong. But wait, is there evidence that Lincoln would have taken that stance? The speaker is assuming that Lincoln's position on affirmative action (which is a modern concept) would align with Dole's, but there's no actual evidence provided. This seems like an appeal to authority, because the speaker is using Lincoln's name to support the argument without providing relevant evidence. However, Lincoln isn't an expert on affirmative action, so maybe it's a different fallacy?

Wait, the Appeal to Authority is when you cite an authority without relevant evidence. But in this case, the speaker is using Lincoln's historical stance (even though it's not directly related) to argue against Dole's position. But since Lincoln is a historical figure, maybe the speaker is implying that because Lincoln believed in certain principles (like the American dream), he would oppose affirmative action. However, this is an assumption. The speaker isn't providing evidence that Lincoln would have taken that position, just using his name to lend credibility. That sounds like an appeal to authority because they're using a figure's name to support the argument without proper evidence. 

Alternatively, could this be an ad hominem? The statement is not attacking the person but using their position. The original statement is not attacking Bob Dole's character, but rather suggesting that Lincoln wouldn't support Dole's position. So maybe not ad hominem. 

Another angle: False cause? The speaker is linking Lincoln's hypothetical position to the current debate, but there's no causal link established. The argument is more about using a historical figure's name to support a claim, which is appeal to authority. 

Wait, the original statement is not directly attacking the person but using their position. The speaker is saying that Lincoln wouldn't support Dole's position, implying that Dole's position is wrong because Lincoln wouldn't support it. This is an appeal to authority, as the speaker is using Lincoln's supposed stance as an authority figure. However, Lincoln's stance on affirmative action isn't established here. So the speaker is assuming that Lincoln's beliefs (which are not directly relevant) would support the argument. This is a misuse of authority, so Appeal to Authority (1). 

Alternatively, could it be a false cause? If the speaker is implying that because Lincoln believed in the American dream, he would oppose affirmative action, that's a false cause. But the statement is more about using Lincoln as an authority figure rather than establishing a causal link. 

Wait, the speaker is using Lincoln's historical position (even if it's not directly related) to argue against Dole's position. This is an appeal to authority, as the speaker is invoking a respected figure's name without evidence. So classification would be 1. 

But wait, another thought: the speaker is not citing an authority in the field of affirmative action but using a historical figure. However, the fallacy is still appeal to authority. So the answer is 1.
