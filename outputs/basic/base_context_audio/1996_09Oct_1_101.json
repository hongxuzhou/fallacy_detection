    "analysis": "The statement cites Abraham Lincoln's quote to support the argument that serving the nation is the best way to serve one's party. This relies on the authority of Lincoln's historical stature to lend credibility to the claim, rather than providing substantive evidence. While Lincoln is a respected figure, the argument hinges on his authority rather than logical reasoning or empirical evidence, fitting the definition of an Appeal to Authority.",
