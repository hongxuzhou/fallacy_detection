Okay, let's tackle this. The statement in question is: "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." The date is 1996, so it's from a presidential debate. The context mentions that the speaker is contrasting their plan with a $550 billion tax scheme, and they mention that even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair, D'Amato, has to cut Medicare to pay for it. The statement is part of an argument against the tax scheme.

First, I need to identify the fallacy type. The options are Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), Ad Hominem (2), False Cause (3), Slippery Slope (4), or Slogans (5). 

The statement cites 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates as saying the plan is bad for the economy. That sounds like an appeal to authority because the speaker is using the credentials of experts (Nobel Prize winners) to support their claim. But wait, the key here is whether the argument is relying on the authority's opinion without proper evidence. However, the statement doesn't just mention the experts' existence; it's stating that "everybody who's looked at it" agrees. But the problem is that even if these experts have authority, the speaker is using their agreement as the main support without providing the actual evidence or reasoning. 

But wait, Appeal to Authority (1) is when the arguer mentions an authority or group without relevant evidence, or uses popular non-experts. In this case, the speaker is citing economists and Nobel laureates, who are indeed experts. However, the fallacy here might be that the argument is relying on the authority's opinion rather than presenting the actual evidence. However, if the argument is that the experts have already evaluated it and say it's bad, then it's an appeal to authority. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause? No, because the statement isn't about a cause and effect. The statement is about the experts' opinion. So, Appeal to Authority (1) seems more likely. 

But wait, sometimes when someone cites a lot of experts, it can be an appeal to authority. However, if the experts are actually relevant and their opinion is valid, then it's not necessarily a fallacy. But in the context of a political debate, the speaker might be using the authority of the economists to bolster their argument without providing the actual data. So the fallacy here is Appeal to Authority (1) because the speaker is relying on the authority of the economists and Nobel laureates without providing the actual evidence or reasoning. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a slippery slope? No, because the statement isn't predicting a series of events leading to an extreme outcome. It's just stating that experts say it's bad. 

So the classification would be Appeal to Authority (1). But wait, the statement says "everybody who's looked at it" which might be an appeal to popularity, but the Nobel laureates are experts. So the main fallacy is Appeal to Authority. Therefore, the answer is 1.
