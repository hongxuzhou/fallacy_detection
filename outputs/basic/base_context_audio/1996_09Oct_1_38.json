    "analysis": "The statement invokes Abraham Lincoln as a historical authority to argue against Bob Dole's position on affirmative action. However, there is no evidence provided that Lincoln would have supported or opposed Dole's stance, as Lincoln lived long before affirmative action existed. This is an appeal to authority, as the speaker uses Lincoln's name to lend credibility to the argument without substantiating the claim with relevant evidence.",
