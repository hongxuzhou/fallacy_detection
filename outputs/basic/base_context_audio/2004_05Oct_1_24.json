    "analysis": "The statement cites George Tenet, a CIA director, to support the argument about Iraq's connection to terrorists and WMDs. However, it does not provide specific evidence from Tenet's testimony, relying instead on his authority without substantiating the claim. This fits the 'Appeal to Authority' fallacy (category 1), as the argument hinges on the credibility of the authority figure rather than presenting relevant evidence or logical reasoning.",
