Okay, let's tackle this fallacy classification. The statement in question is: "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." The context is from a 2020 presidential debate, and the speaker is emotional, with high arousal and dominance.

First, I need to understand the statement. The speaker is saying that because the opponent (he) hasn't said something (maybe about a policy or issue), they are "dying with it," and that he claimed it's dangerous. Wait, the phrasing is a bit confusing. Maybe the speaker is arguing that since the opponent didn't address something (maybe a policy), the situation is dire, and the opponent's previous statement about it being dangerous is being referenced.

Looking at the context, the speaker is talking about people reaching for a spouse who's gone, implying a situation of loss or grief. The statement seems to link the opponent's failure to address something (maybe a policy) with the current dire state ("dying with it"). But the exact connection isn't clear. 

Now, considering the fallacy categories. The options are Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), Ad Hominem (2), False Cause (3), Slippery Slope (4), or Slogans (5). 

The statement uses emotional language like "dying with it" which could be an appeal to emotion, but the structure might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to emotion because it's trying to evoke a strong emotional response about the danger. But the part "because he's never said" might be attacking the opponent's position or credibility. Wait, the speaker is saying that since the opponent hasn't said something (maybe a specific statement), the situation is bad. But the opponent previously said it's dangerous. So perhaps the speaker is implying that the opponent's failure to address the issue (not saying something) is leading to danger, which might be a false cause? Or is it an ad hominem attack on the opponent's credibility? 

Alternatively, the phrase "he's never said" might be an ad hominem, attacking the opponent's position by saying they haven't made a statement, implying they're not credible. But the statement also says "he said it's dangerous," which could be a reference to past statements. However, the speaker is using the opponent's past statement to argue that the current situation is dangerous, which might be a false cause if they're assuming that the opponent's statement is the cause of the current problem. 

Wait, the original statement is "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." The structure is a bit unclear. Maybe the speaker is saying that because the opponent didn't say something (maybe a specific policy or action), they are in a dangerous situation, but the opponent previously said it's dangerous. So the speaker is connecting the opponent's failure to address the issue (not saying something) with the danger. But that might be a false cause, assuming that the opponent's lack of statement causes the danger. Alternatively, it could be an appeal to emotion, using the phrase "dying with it" to evoke a strong emotional response. 

But the main point here is that the speaker is using emotional language ("dying with it") to make the audience feel the severity, which would fall under Appeal to Emotion (0), specifically loaded language. The "dying with it" is emotionally charged. Alternatively, if the speaker is attacking the opponent's credibility by saying they never said something, that could be an ad hominem (2), but the statement isn't directly attacking the opponent's character, just their statements. 

Alternatively, the speaker might be making a false cause by linking the opponent's failure to say something with the current danger. But the statement is a bit ambiguous. However, the key part is the emotional language. The speaker is using strong emotional terms to make the audience feel the danger, which is an appeal to emotion. The mention of "he said it's dangerous" might be a reference to the opponent's previous statements, but the main fallacy here is the emotional appeal. 

So the classification would be Appeal to Emotion (0), specifically loaded language. Therefore, the answer is 0.
