Okay, let's tackle this fallacy analysis. The statement in question is: "Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe." The context is from a 2020 presidential debate, and the speaker is addressing someone named Joe, likely a political opponent.

First, I need to identify the type of fallacy. Let's break down the statement. The speaker is accusing Joe of being "all talk and no action," which is a direct attack on Joe's character or credibility. This seems like an ad hominem fallacy. But wait, there are subtypes of ad hominem. The general ad hominem is attacking the person's character rather than the argument. The statement doesn't just attack Joe's character but also uses a label ("all talk and no action") which could be name-calling. 

Looking at the options, ad hominem includes name-calling. The statement uses a derogatory label to dismiss Joe's argument, which fits under the ad hominem category, specifically name-calling. The other options: appeal to emotion might involve emotional language, but the statement here is more about attacking the person rather than evoking emotions. Appeal to authority isn't present here. False cause or slippery slope don't apply. Slogans are brief phrases, but this is more of a direct attack. 

So the classification should be 2 (Ad Hominem), specifically name-calling. The context also shows the speaker is emotionally charged, which might support an appeal to emotion, but the main fallacy here is the personal attack. Therefore, the answer is Ad Hominem (2).
