    "analysis": "The statement attributes a personal trait (bad judgment) to Hillary Clinton, which is an attack on her character rather than addressing her policies or arguments. This aligns with the ad hominem fallacy, specifically the general ad hominem sub-type, as it undermines Clinton's credibility by focusing on her judgment rather than engaging with the substance of her position. The speaker uses Bernie Sanders' comment to delegitimize Clinton's stance, which is a classic example of attacking the person instead of the argument.",
