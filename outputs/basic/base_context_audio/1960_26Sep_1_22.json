    "analysis": "The statement attributes the sustained vetoes to the majority's support for the President, implying a causal relationship between the majority's backing and the vetoes being sustained. However, the speaker does not provide evidence to substantiate this causal link, merely asserting that the majority's support is the reason. This misinterpretation of correlation as causation fits the False Cause fallacy, as it assumes a direct cause-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.",
