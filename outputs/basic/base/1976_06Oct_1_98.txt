Okay, let's tackle this fallacy classification. The statement is: "If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world."

First, I need to understand the structure of the argument. The speaker is saying that the US action in southern Africa prevented more bloodshed. The key here is the causal link between the US moving and the prevention of bloodshed. 

Now, looking at the fallacy categories. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, Slogans. 

The statement is making a causal claim. It's saying that the US action caused a prevention of bloodshed. But does it have any evidence? The statement seems to assume that the US action was the reason for the lack of bloodshed, which might be a case of False Cause. False Cause is when two events are correlated, but it's claimed that one caused the other without sufficient evidence. 

Wait, but the statement is a conditional: if the US hadn't acted, there would have been more bloodshed. That's a causal claim. However, the problem here is that the speaker is asserting that the US action was the cause, possibly without evidence. But is this a False Cause fallacy? Or is it a different type?

Alternatively, maybe it's a Slippery Slope? No, because Slippery Slope is about a chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. Here, the statement isn't about a series of steps leading to a bad outcome, but rather a direct causal link between the US action and the prevention of bloodshed. 

Another angle: Appeal to Emotion? The statement uses "tragic part of the world" and "acceleration of bloodshed," which might be emotionally charged. But the main argument is about causation, not just emotional appeal. The emotional language might be part of the appeal, but the primary fallacy would be the causal link. 

Wait, but the original statement doesn't have any emotional language that's trying to manipulate the audience's feelings. It's more about the cause-effect relationship. So maybe False Cause. The speaker is assuming that the US action was the cause of preventing bloodshed, but there might be other factors. 

Alternatively, could it be an Appeal to Authority? The statement doesn't mention any authority, so probably not. Ad Hominem? No, there's no attack on the person. Slogans? The statement is a conditional statement, not a slogan. 

So the main issue is the causal link. The statement is making a causal claim without sufficient evidence, which fits the False Cause fallacy (category 3). Therefore, the classification would be 3.
