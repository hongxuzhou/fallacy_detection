    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('prejudiced') to evoke a moral reaction, which is a form of loaded language. It does not rely on logical reasoning, authority, or causal relationships, nor does it attack individuals or use a slogan. The emotional weight of the term 'prejudiced' is intended to sway the audience's feelings rather than present a rational argument.",
