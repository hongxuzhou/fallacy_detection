Okay, let's take a look at this statement. The user wants me to classify the fallacy type. The statement is: "And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton."

First, I need to break down the statement. The speaker is talking about the need for leadership, saying that with some, things would improve quickly. Then they claim there's no leadership, and attribute that to Secretary Clinton. 

Now, looking at the fallacy categories. Let's consider each one. Appeal to Emotion: The statement uses emotional language like "beautiful" and "inner cities," which might be trying to evoke feelings, but I'm not sure if that's the main fallacy here. Appeal to Authority: The mention of Secretary Clinton as a leader might be an appeal to authority, but the speaker is saying that the lack of leadership starts with her, which could be a different fallacy. Ad Hominem: The statement attacks Secretary Clinton's leadership, implying that because she's in charge, there's no leadership. That sounds like an ad hominem, maybe the general type, attacking her character or position. False Cause: Is there a false cause here? The speaker might be suggesting that the lack of leadership is solely because of Clinton, which could be a false cause if there are other factors. Slippery Slope: Not sure. The statement doesn't talk about a series of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. Slogans: The statement isn't a slogan but more of an argument.

Wait, the key part is "that starts with Secretary Clinton." This seems like an attack on the person (Clinton) rather than addressing the actual issue of leadership. So, this could be an ad hominem, specifically the general ad hominem, which attacks the opponent's character or position. Alternatively, if it's implying that Clinton is the sole cause of the lack of leadership, maybe it's a false cause. But the main attack here is on the person, not just the cause. Also, the phrase "starts with" might be a way to shift blame to her, which is a personal attack. So I think Ad Hominem is the right category here. Let me check the subtypes again. General ad hominem is attacking the person's character or position. Yes, the statement is saying that the lack of leadership is because of Clinton, which is attacking her as the source of the problem, so it's a general ad hominem. Therefore, the classification should be 2.
