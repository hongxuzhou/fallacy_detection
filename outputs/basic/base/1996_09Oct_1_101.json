    "analysis": "The statement cites Abraham Lincoln's quote to support the argument, relying on his historical authority rather than providing evidence or reasoning. This is an appeal to authority (1) because it uses the name of an authority figure (Lincoln) to validate the claim without establishing a direct connection between Lincoln's authority and the specific argument being made.",
