    "analysis": "The statement cites the opinions of General Ridgway and Secretary of State Herter to support the speaker's position. This relies on the authority of these individuals rather than presenting independent evidence or reasoning. While quoting experts can be valid, the fallacy here arises from using their authority as the primary basis for the argument without substantiating the claim with evidence. This aligns with Appeal to Authority (1), as the argument hinges on the credibility of the cited authorities rather than logical or empirical support.",
