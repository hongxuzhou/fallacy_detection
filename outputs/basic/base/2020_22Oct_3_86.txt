Okay, let's tackle this fallacy classification. The statement given is: "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." 

First, I need to break down the statement. The speaker is saying that because the opponent (he) hasn't said something (maybe a specific policy or statement), they're "dying with it," which seems like a strong emotional claim. Then the reasoning given is that the opponent said it's dangerous. Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Maybe the structure is that the speaker is arguing that since the opponent hasn't made a certain statement (maybe a positive one), they're in trouble, and the opponent's own statement that something is dangerous is the reason. 

But looking at the structure, the phrase "We're dying with it" is a strong emotional statement, implying a dire situation. The reason given is that the opponent hasn't said something (maybe a specific thing), and the opponent's own statement that it's dangerous. Wait, maybe the original statement is a bit more complex. Let me re-read it. 

The statement is: "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." The structure seems like the speaker is saying that because the opponent (he) never said something (maybe a specific statement), they're in a bad situation ("dying with it"), and then the opponent said it's dangerous. Maybe the speaker is trying to imply that the opponent's own statement that something is dangerous is the reason for the current state. 

But how does that fit into fallacies? Let me consider the categories. 

Looking at the options: Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), Ad Hominem (2), False Cause (3), Slippery Slope (4), Slogans (5). 

The phrase "We're dying with it" is emotionally charged. That might be an appeal to emotion, specifically loaded language or flag waving. The speaker is using strong emotional language to provoke a reaction. 

Alternatively, maybe the reasoning is a false cause. If the speaker is saying that because the opponent hasn't made a certain statement (maybe a positive one), the situation is bad, but the opponent's statement that it's dangerous is the cause. Wait, that might be a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the speaker is using the opponent's own statement against them. For example, if the opponent said something is dangerous, but the speaker is using that to imply that the opponent is responsible for the current situation. But the structure isn't entirely clear. 

Wait, the statement seems to be a bit of a run-on. Let me parse it again. The speaker says, "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." Maybe the intended meaning is that the opponent hasn't said something (maybe a specific positive statement), and the speaker is implying that because the opponent hasn't said that, they're in trouble, but the opponent's own statement that it's dangerous is the reason. 

Alternatively, perhaps the speaker is trying to say that the opponent's failure to make a certain statement (maybe a positive one) is leading to the current problem, and the opponent's own statement that it's dangerous is the cause. But this seems like a possible false cause, where the speaker is assuming a causal relationship without proper evidence. 

But the emotional language like "dying with it" is more of an appeal to emotion. However, the structure of the argument might be a false cause if they're implying that the opponent's failure to say something (maybe a positive statement) is causing the problem, and the opponent's statement that it's dangerous is the reason. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the speaker is using the opponent's own statement that it's dangerous as a reason for the current situation, which might be a false cause. But the structure is confusing. 

Alternatively, the statement might be an appeal to emotion because of the phrase "we're dying with it," which is emotionally charged. The rest of the sentence might be trying to provide a reason, but the reasoning is weak. 

Another angle: the phrase "he's never said" might be an ad hominem if they're attacking the opponent's lack of statements. But the statement is not directly attacking the opponent's character but rather their statements. 

Wait, the options include Appeal to Emotion (0), which includes loaded language. The phrase "dying with it" is emotionally loaded. So maybe that's an appeal to emotion. 

Alternatively, the structure could be a false cause if they're implying that the opponent's failure to say something (maybe a positive statement) is the cause of the current situation. But the exact structure is unclear. 

Given the options, the most likely fallacy is Appeal to Emotion (0) because of the emotionally charged language. The rest of the statement might be trying to provide a reason, but the emotional language is the key part. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause if the speaker is misattributing causation. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the phrase "dying with it" is definitely emotionally loaded, so Appeal to Emotion seems more likely. 

So the classification would be 0 for Appeal to Emotion, specifically loaded language.
