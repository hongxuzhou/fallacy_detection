    "analysis": "The statement references the frequency of administrations addressing the Middle East issue since World War II. However, it does not explicitly appeal to an authority figure or group, nor does it commit a logical fallacy by misrepresenting causation, emotional manipulation, or attacking the opponent. The statement is a factual historical observation rather than a fallacious argument. Since none of the listed fallacies directly apply, the closest classification is 'Appeal to Authority' if implying majority consensus as authority, though this is a weak fit.",
