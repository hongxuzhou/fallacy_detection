Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is: "And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper." 

First, I need to figure out what fallacy this is. Let me break it down. The speaker is accusing the president of being a "flip-flopper" and "wishy-washy," which are negative labels. The phrase "running around the country" might be an appeal to emotion, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the key part here is the use of the labels "flip-flopper" and "wishy-washy." These are derogatory terms that attack the opponent's character rather than addressing the actual argument. That sounds like name-calling, which falls under the Ad Hominem category. Specifically, name-calling is a sub-type of Ad Hominem where the opponent is labeled with an offensive term. 

But let me check other possibilities. Is there an appeal to emotion here? The statement mentions the president being busy, but that's more about the actions rather than emotional manipulation. The main issue is the labeling. The speaker isn't attacking the president's policies but is instead using negative labels to discredit the opponent. 

Also, the phrase "using what I just described to you as a reason" might be implying that the president is using the same tactics against them, which could be a tu quoque attack. But the main focus here is the labeling. 

So, the primary fallacy here is name-calling, which is part of Ad Hominem. Therefore, the classification should be 2 (Ad Hominem) with the sub-type being name-calling.
