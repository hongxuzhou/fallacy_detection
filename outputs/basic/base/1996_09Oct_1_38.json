    "analysis": "The statement uses Abraham Lincoln's historical stance as a reference to discredit Bob Dole's position on affirmative action. This is an appeal to authority, as it cites a historical figure (Lincoln) as an authority on the issue, even though he is not an expert on affirmative action. The argument assumes Lincoln's hypothetical position is authoritative without providing evidence to support the claim that Lincoln would endorse or oppose the policy. This falls under the Appeal to Authority fallacy because it relies on the name of a non-expert figure to bolster the argument.",
