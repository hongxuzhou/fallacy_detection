Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is: "We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office." 

First, I need to figure out what type of fallacy this is. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans.

Looking at the statement, it's comparing the current number of unemployed Americans to the number when Mr. Ford took office. The key here might be the implication that the current situation is worse because of Ford's policies. But wait, the statement doesn't directly say that Ford's policies caused the increase. It just states a fact about the numbers. However, if the speaker is using this to imply that Ford is responsible, that could be a false cause fallacy. False Cause is when there's a mistaken causal link between two events. 

Wait, but the statement itself is just stating a correlation between the time Ford took office and the current unemployment numbers. The fallacy would be if they assumed that Ford's presidency caused the increase without evidence. But the statement doesn't explicitly make that causal claim. It's just stating the numbers. However, in the context of a presidential debate, the speaker might be implying that Ford's policies led to the current unemployment, which would be a false cause. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to emotion? If they're trying to evoke fear or concern about the unemployment numbers, but the statement is more about presenting a fact rather than emotional language. 

Wait, the statement is a factual claim about numbers. But in the context of a debate, the speaker might be using this to attack Ford's policies, which could be an ad hominem if they're attacking Ford's character based on the numbers. But the statement itself doesn't attack Ford's character directly. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause because the speaker is implying that the current unemployment is due to Ford's actions, even though there might be other factors. The fallacy here would be assuming causation from correlation. So that would be False Cause (3). 

But I need to check if the statement is making a causal claim. The statement is stating a fact that there are more unemployed now than when Ford took office. It doesn't explicitly say that Ford's policies caused it, but in the context of a debate, the implication might be that the current administration's policies are responsible. However, the statement itself is just presenting the data. 

Wait, maybe it's not a fallacy at all. But the question says to classify it as one of the listed fallacies. Let me think again. The statement could be an example of false cause if the speaker is implying that the increase in unemployment is due to Ford's policies. But if the speaker is just stating the numbers without making a causal link, then it's not a fallacy. However, in the context of a political debate, the implication might be that the current situation is worse because of Ford's policies, which would be a false cause. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a slippery slope if they're suggesting that the current unemployment will lead to more problems. But the statement doesn't mention any chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. 

So, the most likely fallacy here is False Cause (3) because the speaker is using the correlation between Ford's presidency and the current unemployment numbers to imply causation, possibly without evidence. Therefore, the classification would be 3.
