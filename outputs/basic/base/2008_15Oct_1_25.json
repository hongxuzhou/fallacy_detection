    "analysis": "The statement implies that removing state laws regulating insurers (under Senator McCain's plan) will directly lead to insurers 'cherry-picking' and excluding people from coverage. This assumes a causal relationship between the policy change and the negative outcome without providing evidence of such a direct link. The argument misinterprets a correlation (insurers acting negatively under less regulation) as a definitive cause, which fits the definition of a False Cause fallacy.",
