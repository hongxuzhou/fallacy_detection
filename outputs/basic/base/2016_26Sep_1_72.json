    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('you can't do what you're looking to do') to evoke fear about the debt, which is a classic appeal to emotion. Additionally, the exaggerated claim of '230 years' worth of debt' is a form of loaded language designed to intensify the emotional response. The argument does not rely on logical causation or factual evidence, but rather on stirring emotional reactions to support the claim.",
