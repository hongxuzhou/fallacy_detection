{
    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language such as 'long, long war' and 'steadfast determination' to evoke a sense of urgency and necessity, which falls under the Appeal to Emotion category. The repetition of 'long' intensifies the emotional weight of the argument, aiming to sway the audience's feelings rather than relying on logical evidence. While the statement outlines policy goals, the emotional language serves to manipulate the audience's perception of the situation's gravity.",
