    "analysis": "The statement references George Tenet, a high-ranking official (CIA director), to support an argument. This is an appeal to authority (1) because it relies on the credibility of Tenet's position rather than providing direct evidence or reasoning. The argument assumes Tenet's testimony is authoritative without substantiating the claim with specific details from his testimony.",
