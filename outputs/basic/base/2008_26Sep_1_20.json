    "analysis": "The statement cites Admiral Mullen's suggestion as a basis for evaluating Senator Obama's plan. This relies on the authority of Admiral Mullen, who is a respected military figure, to lend credibility to the claim. However, the statement does not provide evidence or context to support why Admiral Mullen's opinion is relevant or authoritative on the specific issue of Senator Obama's plan. This fits the definition of an Appeal to Authority (1), as it uses the name of an authority figure without sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim.",
