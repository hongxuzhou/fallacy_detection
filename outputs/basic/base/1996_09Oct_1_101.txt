Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is: "Clearly, Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve your party best by serving the nation first." 

First, I need to figure out what kind of fallacy this is. Let me recall the categories. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans.

The statement is quoting Abraham Lincoln. The speaker is using Lincoln's quote to support their argument. So, is this an appeal to authority? Because they're citing an authority figure (Lincoln) to back up their claim. But wait, does the statement mention Lincoln's authority in this context? The quote itself is about serving the nation over the party. The speaker is using Lincoln's authority to make their point. However, the fallacy here might be Appeal to Authority if they're using Lincoln's status without proper evidence. But the quote is from Lincoln, so if the speaker is using his authority as an expert on the matter, that could be an appeal to authority. Alternatively, maybe it's a slogan if it's a catchy phrase. But the statement is not just a slogan; it's using a historical figure's quote. 

Wait, the options include Appeal to Authority (1) which is when the arguer mentions an authority without relevant evidence. But in this case, the speaker is using a quote from Lincoln to support their argument. However, the quote itself is about serving the nation, not necessarily that Lincoln is an authority on party service. The fallacy here might be that the speaker is using Lincoln's authority to make their point, even if the quote is not directly relevant. Alternatively, maybe it's not a fallacy at all, but the question is to classify it as one of the fallacies given. 

Alternatively, could it be a false cause? No, because there's no correlation being misinterpreted as causation. Slippery slope? No, there's no exaggerated outcome. Ad Hominem? No, they're not attacking the person. Appeal to emotion? Not really, there's no emotional language. Slogans? The statement is a quote, not a slogan. 

Wait, the statement is using Lincoln's quote to support their argument. If the speaker is using Lincoln's authority as an expert in this matter, then it's an appeal to authority. However, if the speaker is using the quote as a slogan, but the quote is from a historical figure, perhaps it's not a slogan. Alternatively, maybe it's a false authority if Lincoln isn't an expert on the topic. But Lincoln was a president, so he's an authority on government, but the quote is about serving the nation over the party. So the speaker is using Lincoln's authority to back up their point. So that would be Appeal to Authority (1). 

Wait, but the statement says "Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said..." So the speaker is using Lincoln's authority to support their argument. That's an appeal to authority. Therefore, classification 1.
