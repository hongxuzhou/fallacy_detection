    "analysis": "The statement references the president, Congress, and the people as authorities, implying their agreement validates the claim. However, the structure is a conditional ('if... said...'), which does not directly assert the claim's truth. The fallacy lies in assuming the authority of these groups automatically supports the claim without evidence, fitting the 'Appeal to Authority' category. The conditional phrasing may obscure the fallacy, but the core issue is leveraging authority without substantiation.",
