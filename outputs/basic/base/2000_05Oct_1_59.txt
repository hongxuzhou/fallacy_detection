Okay, let's break this down. The statement is from a presidential debate, so it's likely a political argument. The speaker mentions a friend who's an African-American working at the White House, stopped by police solely because of his skin color. They say this can't happen in America anymore.

First, I need to identify the fallacy. Let's look at the categories. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, Slogans.

The statement is emotional, talking about a personal experience that evokes feelings of injustice. The friend's story is used to evoke sympathy and highlight racial issues. The speaker is trying to stir emotions by sharing a personal anecdote that suggests systemic racism. 

Looking at Appeal to Emotion (0), subcategories include appeal to pity, fear, loaded language, or flag waving. Here, the story is meant to provoke an emotional response, possibly fear or outrage about racial discrimination. The mention of being stopped by police for the color of his skin is a loaded statement that's emotionally charged. The speaker is using this personal story to make a broader point about America's current state, which could be seen as an appeal to emotion.

Is it another fallacy? Appeal to Authority (1) doesn't fit because there's no mention of an expert or authority. Ad Hominem (2) would involve attacking the person's character, but the speaker isn't attacking the opponent directly here. False Cause (3) is about correlation vs. causation, which isn't the case here. Slippery Slope (4) suggests a chain of events leading to an extreme outcome, which isn't present. Slogans (5) are catchy phrases, but this is a narrative, not a slogan.

So the main fallacy here is Appeal to Emotion, specifically using a personal story to evoke emotional response to support the argument. The loaded language about being stopped for the color of one's skin is emotionally charged, which fits under appeal to emotion. The subcategory could be loaded language or flag waving, but since it's a personal story, maybe appeal to emotion in general. The classification would be 0.
