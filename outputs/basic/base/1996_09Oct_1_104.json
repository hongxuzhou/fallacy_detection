    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language such as 'The American Dream' and emphasizes concepts like 'democratic' and 'progress' to evoke a sense of national identity and hope. This appeals to the audience's emotional instincts by associating capitalism with universal ideals, rather than presenting factual evidence. The phrase 'The American Dream' is a loaded term that evokes strong emotional responses, fitting the 'loaded language' sub-category of Appeal to Emotion.",
