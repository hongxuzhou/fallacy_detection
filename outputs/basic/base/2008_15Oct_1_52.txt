Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is: "The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression."

First, I need to figure out what kind of fallacy this is. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans.

Looking at the statement, the speaker is blaming the previous administration's policies and Washington's inaction for the current economic crisis. The key here is whether they're attacking the person (Ad Hominem) or making a causal link that's not justified (False Cause). 

Wait, the statement doesn't directly attack the person's character, but rather their policies. However, the phrase "Washington's unwillingness" might be a general attack on the group (Washington) rather than a specific person. But the main point is linking the policies and inaction to the crisis. 

Is there a false cause here? The speaker is saying that the policies and inaction caused the crisis. But is there a correlation being mistaken for causation? Maybe. If the speaker is assuming that because the policies were in place and Washington didn't act, the crisis happened, without considering other factors, that's a False Cause. 

Alternatively, could it be an appeal to emotion? The statement uses strong language like "worst economic crisis since the Great Depression" which is emotionally charged, but the main argument is about causation. 

Wait, the structure seems to be attributing the crisis to the policies and inaction. The fallacy here might be False Cause (3) because it's implying a causal relationship between the policies and the crisis without sufficient evidence. The speaker is suggesting that the policies and inaction directly caused the crisis, which might not be proven. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a Slippery Slope (4) if they're suggesting that the policies led to a series of negative outcomes. But the statement doesn't mention a chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. It just states that the crisis happened because of those factors. 

So, I think False Cause (3) is the best fit here. The speaker is making a causal link between the policies and the crisis, which might not be supported by evidence. They're attributing the crisis to the policies and inaction without establishing a direct cause-effect relationship, which is a classic False Cause fallacy.
