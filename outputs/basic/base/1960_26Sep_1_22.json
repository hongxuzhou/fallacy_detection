    "analysis": "The statement attributes the sustained vetoes and Congress's behavior to the majority's knowledge of the country being 'behind the President.' This relies on the majority's acceptance as a reason, which is a form of appeal to authority. The speaker cites the majority's opinion (a group of people) as the justification for the outcome, without providing evidence of a direct causal link. This fits the 'acceptance of the claim by the majority' sub-category under Appeal to Authority.",
