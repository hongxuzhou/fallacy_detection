Okay, let's tackle this fallacy classification. The statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." Hmm, first, I need to figure out what kind of fallacy this might be. Let me recall the categories given.

Looking at the options, the user listed Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, and Slogans. 

The statement seems like a general principle or a moral assertion. It's not really attacking someone's character or using emotional language. Maybe it's not an appeal to authority either because it's not citing an expert. 

Wait, could it be a slogan? Slogans are brief, striking phrases used to provoke excitement. This statement is a bit of a maxim, maybe used to rally support or emphasize a value. It's a concise phrase that's repeated, which fits the definition of a slogan. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause? But false cause is about assuming causation from correlation. This doesn't seem to do that. Or maybe a slippery slope? No, that's about a chain of events leading to an extreme outcome. 

So the most likely is Slogans (5). The statement is a concise, memorable phrase that's used to evoke a sense of moral obligation or commitment, which is common in political rhetoric. It's not making an argument with evidence but rather using a catchy phrase to influence the audience.
