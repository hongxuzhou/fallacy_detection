Okay, let's break down this statement: "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." 

First, I need to identify the type of fallacy here. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans.

The statement mentions a large number of economists and Nobel laureates. That makes me think it's related to authority. But wait, Appeal to Authority is when someone cites an authority without relevant evidence or uses non-experts. Here, they're citing economists and Nobel winners, who are experts in economics. So maybe that's not a fallacy? But wait, the problem is that just because many experts say something doesn't necessarily make it true. But is this a fallacy?

Wait, the question is about fallacies. Appeal to Authority (1) is when the arguer mentions an authority without providing relevant evidence, or mentions popular non-experts. But in this case, the economists and Nobel winners are relevant experts. However, the statement is saying that "everybody who's looked at it" (which is 500 economists and seven Nobel prize winners) say it's bad. But does that mean they are using the authority of these experts as a reason? If the argument is that because these experts say it's bad, therefore it's bad, that's an appeal to authority. But maybe it's not a fallacy if the experts are indeed relevant. Wait, but the problem is that the statement is not providing evidence, just citing the experts. However, in reality, even if experts say something, that's not necessarily a fallacy. But in logical fallacies, Appeal to Authority is a fallacy when the authority isn't relevant or the claim is not supported by the authority's expertise. 

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of appeal to authority. Let me check the definition again. Appeal to Authority is when the arguer mentions an authority or a group who agreed with the claim without providing relevant evidence, or by mentioning popular non-experts. But here, the arguer is citing actual experts (Nobel laureates, economists), so maybe it's not a fallacy. Wait, but the problem is that the statement is using the number of experts as a form of argument. However, if the argument is that because these experts have said it, the claim is true, that's an appeal to authority. However, in some cases, citing experts can be valid, but if the argument relies solely on their authority without evidence, it's a fallacy. 

Wait, the original statement says "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." So the arguer is using the fact that these experts have looked at it and agree. But is that a fallacy? If the argument is that since these experts agree, the claim is true, that's an appeal to authority. But maybe it's not a fallacy if the experts are relevant. However, the problem is that the statement doesn't provide any evidence, just the number of experts. So even if they are experts, if the argument is that their agreement is the only reason given, that's an appeal to authority. 

Alternatively, maybe it's not a fallacy. Wait, but in logic, Appeal to Authority is considered a fallacy when the authority is not relevant or the claim isn't within the authority's expertise. However, in this case, the experts are economists, and the claim is about the economy, so their expertise is relevant. But even so, just citing experts doesn't prove the claim. So is this still a fallacy? 

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of appeal to authority. So the classification would be 1. But wait, the answer could be that it's not a fallacy. But the question says to classify as one of the given categories. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause? No, because false cause is about correlation implying causation. 

Or maybe it's a slippery slope? No, because there's no mention of a chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. 

Or appeal to emotion? No, because there's no emotional language. 

Slogans? No, because it's not a brief phrase. 

So the most likely is Appeal to Authority (1). But wait, the statement is saying that "everybody who's looked at it" (the 500 economists and seven Nobel winners) say it's bad. So the argument is that because these experts have looked at it and agree, the claim is true. This is an appeal to authority, even though the experts are relevant. But in logical fallacies, Appeal to Authority is considered a fallacy when the argument relies solely on the authority's opinion without evidence. So even if the authority is relevant, if the argument is based only on that, it's a fallacy. Therefore, the classification would be 1.
