Okay, let's tackle this. The statement is: "It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America." 

First, I need to figure out what kind of fallacy this is. The options are Appeal to Emotion, Appeal to Authority, Ad Hominem, False Cause, Slippery Slope, or Slogans. 

The statement uses a metaphor comparing something to the "buggy and horse days," which is an old, outdated technology. This is likely trying to evoke a sense of backwardness or inefficiency. The idea is that if something is compared to the past, it's implying that it's not modern or not up-to-date. 

Wait, but is this an appeal to emotion? Maybe, because it's using a vivid image to provoke a reaction. However, the key here is whether it's using emotional language to manipulate. The phrase "buggy and horse days" is a loaded term, suggesting something archaic and perhaps inferior. That could be loaded language, which is a sub-category of Appeal to Emotion. 

Alternatively, could this be a False Cause? No, because there's no direct causation being claimed here. The statement is making a comparison, not asserting a cause-effect relationship. 

What about Slogans? The statement is a bit of a metaphor, but it's not a catchy phrase meant to provoke excitement. It's more of a comparison. 

Ad Hominem? No, there's no attack on the person's character or arguments. 

Appeal to Authority? Not really, since there's no mention of an authority figure. 

Slippery Slope? The statement doesn't suggest a chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. 

So, the main point here is the use of emotionally charged language to evoke a negative reaction towards something by comparing it to an outdated era. That fits under Appeal to Emotion, specifically loaded language. 

Wait, but maybe the comparison is meant to be a false cause? Like implying that because something is old, it's bad. But that's more of a false cause if it's claiming that the oldness causes the problem. However, the statement isn't making a causal claim, just a comparison. 

Alternatively, could it be a False Cause? Hmm. Maybe not. The key here is the emotional appeal through the loaded term. So, I think the correct classification is Appeal to Emotion with loaded language. Therefore, the answer is 0.
