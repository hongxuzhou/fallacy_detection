{
    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('bad people') to evoke fear and guilt, which is a form of appeal to emotion. The high crime statistics are presented to create an emotional response, implying that stop-and-frisk is necessary. While there is a mention of specific numbers, the primary fallacy lies in leveraging emotional appeal rather than logical causation or factual evidence. The name-calling ('bad people') is a sub-type of ad hominem, but the dominant fallacy in the argument's structure is the emotional manipulation through loaded language and fear.",
