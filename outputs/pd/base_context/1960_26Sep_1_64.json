    "analysis": "The statement compares price increases between two administrations, but it fails to address the actual standpoint about economic performance. The speaker shifts focus from wages to prices, which is irrelevant to the opponent's claim about wages. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by introducing an unrelated argument. The comparison lacks evidence, implying a causal link between administrations and price changes without justification, which aligns with False Cause (3).",
