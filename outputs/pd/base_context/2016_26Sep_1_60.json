    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('bad people') to evoke fear and moral outrage, which is a clear appeal to emotion. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by introducing irrelevant emotional content to sway the audience. The specific fallacy is Appeal to Emotion (0), as the loaded terms and fear-mongering (e.g., '3,000 shootings') are designed to manipulate emotional responses rather than present logical reasoning. The reference to Obama's presidency and racial demographics further amplifies the emotional appeal, bypassing factual argumentation.",
