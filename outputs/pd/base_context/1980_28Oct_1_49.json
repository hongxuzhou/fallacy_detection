    "analysis": "The statement references the opponent's criticism of the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal as 'voodoo economics,' which is a derogatory label. This constitutes an ad hominem (2) fallacy by attacking the proposal's credibility through name-calling rather than addressing its merits. The speaker avoids directly engaging with the policy's arguments, instead using emotionally charged language to discredit it. This violates the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3) by distorting the opponent's position and the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by misrepresenting the proposal's validity through labeling.",
