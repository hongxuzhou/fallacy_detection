    "analysis": "The statement attributes the economic crisis to the previous administration's policies and Washington's inaction. While it presents a causal claim, it lacks evidence to substantiate this link, violating the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by relying on an appeal to emotion (fear of the Great Depression) rather than logical reasoning. This aligns with False Cause (3) as it misinterprets correlation (recent policies and crisis) as causation without proper justification.",
