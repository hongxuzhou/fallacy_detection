    "analysis": "The statement compares the opponent's interest-rate policy to Truman's past actions, implying the same outcome (inflation) will follow. This violates the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by misinterpreting correlation (similar policies) as causation (same outcome). The speaker assumes the current plan will lead to inflation without evidence, falsely equating historical policy with present consequences. This aligns with False Cause (3) as it misinterprets a correlation (similar policies) as a causal relationship (inevitable inflation).",
