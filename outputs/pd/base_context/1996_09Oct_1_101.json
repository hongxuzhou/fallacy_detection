{
    "analysis": "The statement uses Abraham Lincoln's quote to assert that serving the nation is the best way to serve one's party, but it fails to provide evidence or reasoning to support this claim. The speaker relies on Lincoln's authority without addressing the specific context or relevance of the quote to the argument. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by evading the need to defend the claim with substantive evidence. The fallacy maps to Appeal to Authority (1) because the argument depends on the credibility of Lincoln's authority rather than logical reasoning or empirical support.",
