    "analysis": "The statement accepts the president's assertion without providing evidence or argumentation, violating the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2). By not defending the standpoint when asked, the speaker shifts the burden to the other party. This aligns with Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker relies on the president's authority without substantiating the claim with relevant reasoning.",
