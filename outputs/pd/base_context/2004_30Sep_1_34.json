    "analysis": "The statement 'I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead' relies on the opinion of the American people as a justification for the speaker's claim of victory. This is a classic appeal to authority, where the speaker cites the collective opinion of the populace as an unexamined premise to support their argument. While the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) is violated by using an appeal to authority without proper reasoning, the primary classification falls under Appeal to Authority (1) as the statement hinges on the credibility of the American people's judgment without evidence. The speaker shifts the burden of proof by assuming the people's approval is sufficient, bypassing the need for substantive argumentation.",
