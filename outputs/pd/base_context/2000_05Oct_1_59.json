    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('for no other cause than the color of his skin') to evoke sympathy and highlight injustice, which is a clear appeal to emotion. This falls under the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) violation, as the argument relies on emotional manipulation rather than logical or factual evidence. The loaded language serves to bypass critical discussion by appealing to the audience's emotional instincts rather than addressing the actual standpoint with relevant argumentation.",
