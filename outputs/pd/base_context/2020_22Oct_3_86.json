    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('we're dying with it') to evoke an emotional response, which is a clear violation of the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by introducing irrelevant argumentation. The phrase 'dying' is a loaded term that bypasses logical reasoning and instead appeals to the audience's emotions. This aligns with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category, as the speaker prioritizes emotional impact over substantive argumentation.",
