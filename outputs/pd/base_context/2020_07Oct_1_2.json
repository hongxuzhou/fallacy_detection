    "analysis": "The statement attributes a specific derogatory remark to the opponent, which is then used to discredit their character. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by aiming to discredit the opponent rather than addressing their arguments. The primary PD rule violation is the Freedom Rule, as the speaker uses the opponent's past rhetoric to attack their credibility (Ad Hominem). The statement does not distort the opponent's position (no straw man) nor is it irrelevant (Rule 4). The fallacy is Ad Hominem (2) because it attacks the opponent's character (calling them racist) rather than engaging with their arguments. The classification aligns with the Ad Hominem category as the speaker's focus is on discrediting the opponent's personal stance rather than defending their position.",
