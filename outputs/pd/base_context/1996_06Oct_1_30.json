    "analysis": "The statement shifts the focus from objective economic data to the audience's personal experience, using a rhetorical question to evoke emotional responses. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by introducing irrelevant argumentation that prioritizes emotional appeal over factual defense. The rhetorical question 'are you better off?' is designed to provoke an emotional reaction (e.g., nostalgia or insecurity) rather than engaging in a logical discussion of economic performance. This aligns with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category, as the speaker uses loaded language to manipulate the audience's feelings rather than addressing the actual standpoint with relevant evidence.",
