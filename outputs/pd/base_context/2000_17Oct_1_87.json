    "analysis": "The statement presents a distorted version of the opponent's plan by suggesting that under their proposal, students would be 'trapped' for three years, implying a negative consequence not explicitly stated in the opponent's original argument. This misrepresentation of the opponent's position violates the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3), which requires attacks to address the actual standpoint. The distortion frames the plan in an emotionally charged light ('trapped'), which aligns with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category. While the statement could also be seen as a Straw Man (not explicitly listed in Output Categories), the emotional language ('trapped') and its intent to sway the audience via fear or concern for children's welfare directly map to Appeal to Emotion.",
