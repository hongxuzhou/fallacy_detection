    "analysis": "The statement exaggerates the U.S. debt increase under Obama by claiming it 'doubled' in eight years, which is factually inaccurate. This misrepresentation of data violates the Validity Rule (Rule 7) by presenting invalid reasoning based on a false premise. However, since the output categories require mapping to one of the six, the closest fit is False Cause (3), as the speaker implicitly suggests a causal link between debt accumulation and economic failure without proper evidence. The exaggerated debt figure (230 years' worth) misleads by conflating correlation (debt increase) with causation (economic disaster), fitting the 'misinterpreting correlation as causation' definition of False Cause.",
