    "analysis": "The statement criticizes Mr. Carter by highlighting a perceived contradiction in his economic policies. While the claim about his policy is factual, the primary issue lies in the rhetorical strategy used to undermine his credibility. The speaker shifts focus from the policy's merits to Carter's personal inconsistency, which aligns with the Ad Hominem (2) fallacy. By attacking his character (inconsistency) rather than addressing the economic argument directly, the speaker violates the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3) by not engaging with the actual standpoint. This personal attack distracts from the policy discussion, fitting the Ad Hominem category as it targets the arguer's integrity rather than the argument itself.",
