    "analysis": "The statement suggests that granting the government power to resolve strikes will inevitably lead to wage and price controls, implying an extreme outcome without specifying the intermediate steps. This violates the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by presenting a chain of reasoning that assumes an exaggerated consequence (wage and price control) from a starting premise (government intervention) without justifying the logical connection. The fallacy aligns with the Slippery Slope (4) category, as the speaker omits the necessary steps between government involvement and the undesirable outcome, creating an unjustified causal link.",
