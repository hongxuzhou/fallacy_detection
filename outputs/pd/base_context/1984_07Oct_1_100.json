    "analysis": "The statement avoids directly addressing Mondale's argument about injecting religion into government by shifting focus to the party platform's stance on human life. This violates the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3) by not engaging with the actual argument. The distortion of the opponent's position (avoiding the religious influence issue) aligns with Ad Hominem (2), as it sidesteps the core debate through misrepresentation.",
