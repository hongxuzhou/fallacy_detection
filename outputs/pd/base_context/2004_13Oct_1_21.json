    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('in their guts know') to appeal to the audience's emotions rather than providing logical reasoning.

The phrase 'in their guts know' is vague and loaded, shifting focus from evidence to emotional persuasion, which aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0).",
