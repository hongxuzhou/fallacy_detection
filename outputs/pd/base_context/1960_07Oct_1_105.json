{
    "analysis": "The statement 'We have to practice what we preach.' is a concise, emotionally charged phrase designed to provoke immediate agreement or moral alignment. While it does not directly attack the opponent (violating the Freedom Rule or Standpoint Rule), its primary function is to appeal to the audience's sense of morality through repetition and rhetorical simplicity. This aligns with the Slogans (5) category, as it uses a striking phrase to evoke emotional resonance without providing substantive reasoning. The PD rule violation here is Rule 10 (Language Use Rule), as the statement's vagueness and emotional weight may obscure logical argumentation, but the primary classification focuses on its rhetorical function as a slogan.",
