    "analysis": "The statement 'Our character is on the ballot' uses emotionally charged language ('character') to evoke a response about moral integrity, which is not directly relevant to the debate's policy-focused context. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by introducing an irrelevant appeal to emotion. The loaded term 'character' is vague (violating Rule 10) but maps to Appeal to Emotion (0) as it exploits emotional instincts about integrity rather than providing logical reasoning. The primary violation is the emotional manipulation, making Appeal to Emotion the most appropriate classification.",
