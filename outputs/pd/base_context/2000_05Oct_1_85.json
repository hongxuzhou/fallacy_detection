    "analysis": "The statement asserts that numerous administrations have dealt with the Middle East issue, implying that the problem is longstanding and complex. This avoids directly addressing the current debate's core arguments, thereby evading the burden of proof. While not explicitly citing an authority, the claim relies on the perceived legitimacy of past administrations' handling of the issue, which can be seen as an appeal to authority. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule by shifting the responsibility to the opposing party to disprove the claim rather than providing evidence for the statement.",
