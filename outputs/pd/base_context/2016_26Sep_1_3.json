    "analysis": "The statement attacks Secretary Clinton's character by implying she is the root cause of the nation's lack of leadership, rather than addressing the actual argument about leadership and policy. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by discrediting her instead of engaging with her standpoint. The fallacy falls under Ad Hominem (2) as it directly attacks her personal responsibility rather than defending the opposing argument. The statement's focus on blaming Clinton's character (\"starts with Secretary Clinton\") rather than providing evidence for the claim about leadership aligns with the general ad hominem sub-type.",
