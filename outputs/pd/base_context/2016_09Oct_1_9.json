    "analysis": "The statement attributes a criticism of Hillary Clinton's judgment to Bernie Sanders, using it to undermine her credibility rather than addressing her policy positions directly. This violates the FREEDOM RULE (Rule 1) by attacking Clinton's character (judgment) instead of engaging with her arguments. The primary fallacy is Ad Hominem (2), as it shifts focus from policy critique to personal discrediting. While the statement references Sanders' words, it does not engage with his actual arguments, instead using his critique as a tool to delegitimize Clinton, which aligns with the ad hominem sub-type of attacking an opponent's character.",
