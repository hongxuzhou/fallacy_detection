Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to analyze a statement from a political debate using pragma-dialectical argumentation. The goal is to identify the primary fallacy and classify it into one of the six categories. 

First, I need to understand the statement. The speaker is criticizing Senator Obama, pointing out his votes against certain abortion-related bills and his "present" votes on the floor. The key here is that the speaker is trying to undermine Obama's stance on abortion by highlighting his voting record. 

Looking at the Pragma-Dialectical rules, I should check which ones might be violated. The statement seems to be attacking Obama's actions rather than addressing his actual positions. That makes me think of the Standpoint Rule, which requires attacks to address the actual standpoint. If the speaker is distorting Obama's position, that's a Straw Man fallacy, which falls under Ad Hominem (2) because it's attacking the person's actions rather than their argument. 

Wait, the Standpoint Rule violation is specifically about distorting the opponent's position. The speaker mentions Obama voting against a law providing medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion and then voting "present" on the floor. But "present" usually means not voting, so maybe the speaker is misrepresenting his stance. This could be a Straw Man, which is a type of Ad Hominem. 

Also, the speaker uses emotionally charged language like "terrible," "bad procedures," and "extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement," which might be an Appeal to Emotion (0). But the main issue here is the distortion of Obama's votes. The primary violation seems to be the Standpoint Rule by distorting the actual position. However, the output categories don't have Straw Man as an option. The closest is Ad Hominem (2), which includes attacks on the opponent's character or actions. 

Wait, the Ad Hominem (2) includes straw man as a sub-type. So if the speaker is distorting Obama's position, that's a straw man, which is a type of Ad Hominem. So the primary fallacy here would be Ad Hominem (2). 

Alternatively, maybe it's an Appeal to Emotion (0) because of the loaded language. But the main issue is the distortion of the opponent's position, which is a Standpoint Rule violation leading to Ad Hominem. 

I need to check the PD rules again. The Standpoint Rule violation is when attacks don't address the actual standpoint. The speaker is attacking Obama's voting record, but maybe the actual standpoint is about abortion rights. The speaker is misrepresenting his votes to imply he's pro-abortion, which is a straw man. Therefore, the primary fallacy is Ad Hominem (2). 

So the classification would be 2. Let me make sure there's no other rule. The Burden of Proof isn't violated here. The speaker isn't shifting the burden. The Relevance Rule might be involved, but the main issue is the attack on the person's actions, not relevance. 

Yes, the primary violation is the Standpoint Rule, leading to Ad Hominem (2) as the classification.
