    "analysis": "The statement attacks the opponent's academic credentials by claiming they graduated near the bottom of their class, which is a personal attack on their competence rather than addressing their argument. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by discrediting the opponent's position through an ad hominem attack. The follow-up instruction to avoid using the word 'smart' reinforces the personal attack, undermining the opponent's character rather than engaging with their standpoint. This aligns with Ad Hominem (2) as a primary fallacy.",
