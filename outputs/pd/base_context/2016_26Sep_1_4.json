    "analysis": "The statement attacks Donald Trump's personal circumstances (starting with $14 million from his father) rather than addressing the actual policy argument about helping the wealthy. This violates the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3) by not engaging with the opponent's position and instead undermining their character or background. The attack on Trump's 'fortunate' life and financial advantages is a classic general ad hominem, which falls under the Ad Hominem (2) category. The speaker's focus on personal wealth distracts from the policy discussion, violating the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by silencing or discrediting the opponent's argument through personal attacks.",
