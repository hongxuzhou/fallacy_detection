    "analysis": "The statement reports Admiral Mullen's suggestion about Senator Obama's plan. However, the speaker uses Admiral Mullen's authority to imply the plan's danger without providing evidence. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule by shifting the responsibility to the opponent to validate the claim. The primary fallacy is Appeal to Authority (1) as the speaker relies on an authority figure's opinion without substantiating the claim with relevant evidence.",
