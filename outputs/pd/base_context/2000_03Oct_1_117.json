While it appears to be a general principle, its use in this context serves as a rhetorical device to evoke trust and emotional resonance with the audience. This aligns with the Slogans (5) category, as it is a brief, striking phrase designed to provoke excitement and reinforce the speaker's position through repetition and emotional appeal. The statement does not directly address the specific argument about Social Security funding but instead relies on its rhetorical effect to strengthen the speaker's stance.",
