    "analysis": "The statement asserts a factual claim about the president's role in creating the largest deficits in American history without providing specific evidence or reasoning. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2), as the speaker shifts the responsibility to the opposing party to disprove the claim. While the context references The Washington Post, the statement itself lacks explicit argumentation, relying on the implied authority of the source without addressing the logical connection between the cited data and the conclusion. This aligns with Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker attributes the claim's validity to an external authority without substantive reasoning.",
