    "analysis": "The statement uses a specific example of wasteful spending (bear DNA study) to argue against earmarking, but the example is not directly relevant to the claim about prison sentences due to corruption. This violates the Relevance Rule by introducing an irrelevant argument (ignoratio elenchi). While the example may evoke emotional reactions about wastefulness, the primary violation lies in the misinterpretation of correlation (pork-barrel spending) as causation (corruption), which aligns with the False Cause (3) fallacy.",
