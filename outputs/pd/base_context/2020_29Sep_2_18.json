    "analysis": "The statement 'You don't have it in your blood' is a personal attack targeting the opponent's inherent qualities (e.g., character, capability) rather than addressing their arguments. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by discrediting the opponent through a generalized attack on their character ('blood' implies inherent traits). While it may also touch on relevance (Rule 4), the primary violation is the Freedom Rule's prohibition against discrediting opponents through personal attacks. This maps to Ad Hominem (2), a sub-type of 'general ad hominem' where the argument attacks the person rather than their position.",
