    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('extravagance' and 'fat') to describe government spending, which is a form of loaded language. This appeals to the audience's emotional instincts rather than presenting logical or factual evidence. The term 'fat' metaphorically implies waste, which is subjective and lacks objective criteria, violating the Language Use Rule (Rule 10) by introducing ambiguity. This emotional framing distracts from the actual argument about fraud and waste, making it an Appeal to Emotion (0).",
