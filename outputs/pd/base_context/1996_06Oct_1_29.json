    "analysis": "The statement cites the opinions of 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates to assert that a policy is harmful to the economy. This relies on the authority of experts without providing specific evidence or reasoning. The primary violation is the Relevance Rule (Rule 4), as the argument appeals to authority without establishing a logical connection to the claim. This maps to the Appeal to Authority (1) category, as the speaker shifts the burden of proof by relying on non-expert validation rather than substantive evidence.",
