    "analysis": "The statement cites numerous experts (Nobel laureates, economists, businesspeople) to support its economic ideas, but it does not establish a logical connection between these authorities and the specific claims made. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by using irrelevant argumentation (appeal to authority) without addressing the actual standpoint. The primary violation is the Appeal to Authority (1) fallacy, as the speaker shifts the burden of proof by relying on the credibility of experts rather than providing substantive reasoning. The statement fails to defend its economic plan with relevant arguments, instead leveraging the authority of unnamed individuals to bypass critical scrutiny.",
