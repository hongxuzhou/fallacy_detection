    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('bad people', 'shouldn't be') to evoke a visceral reaction, bypassing logical argumentation. While statistical data about Chicago shootings is presented, the emotional framing dominates, violating the Relevance Rule (4) by prioritizing emotional appeal over relevant, logical reasoning. The loaded terms and implied moral judgment ('bad people') exploit emotional instincts rather than engaging in a rational debate about policy efficacy. This aligns with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category, as the argument relies on emotional manipulation rather than substantive evidence.",
