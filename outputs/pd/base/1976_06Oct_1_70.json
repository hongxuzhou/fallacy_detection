    "analysis": "The statement presents a factual comparison of unemployment numbers but implicitly attributes the increase to the current administration's policies without providing evidence. This violates the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by misinterpreting correlation (unemployment increase over time) as causation (current administration's policies causing the rise). The speaker assumes a direct causal link without addressing intermediate factors or evidence, which is a classic False Cause fallacy (category 3).",
