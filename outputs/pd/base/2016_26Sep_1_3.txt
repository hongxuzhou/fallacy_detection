Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The statement is: "And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton."

First, I need to break this down. The speaker is talking about leadership and its impact, then says there's no leadership, and attributes that to Secretary Clinton. Let me check the PD rules.

Looking at the rules, the main issue here might be the ad hominem. The speaker is attacking Secretary Clinton's character or position by saying that the lack of leadership starts with her. Wait, but is that a direct attack? The statement doesn't directly attack her personal qualities but rather implies that her leadership is the cause of the problem. Hmm.

Wait, the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) says parties must not prevent each other from advancing or questioning standpoints. Violations include ad hominem, which is attacking the person instead of the argument. The speaker is saying that the lack of leadership starts with Clinton, which could be a personal attack. But is it a direct ad hominem? Or is it a different fallacy?

Alternatively, maybe the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) is involved. The speaker is making a claim about leadership but doesn't provide evidence. However, the statement seems more about attacking Clinton rather than shifting the burden of proof.

Looking at the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3), attacks must address the actual standpoint. The speaker is saying that the problem is Clinton's leadership, but if the opponent's standpoint was about leadership, then this could be a straw man. But the statement is more about attacking the person rather than distorting the argument.

Wait, the main issue here is that the speaker is attributing the lack of leadership to Secretary Clinton, which might be a personal attack. That could fall under Ad Hominem (2), specifically the general ad hominem, which attacks the person's character. The speaker is implying that Clinton's lack of leadership is the problem, which is an attack on her competence or character. 

But wait, the statement says "that starts with Secretary Clinton," which might be a way of saying that she is the cause of the lack of leadership. This could be a false cause (3) if they're assuming causation without evidence. But the key here is whether it's attacking the person. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a Slippery Slope (4) if they're implying that without leadership, bad things will happen. But the statement doesn't mention a chain of events leading to an extreme outcome. 

Looking back at the Output Categories, Ad Hominem (2) includes attacks on the opponent's character. The statement doesn't directly attack Clinton's character but attributes the problem to her. However, in the context of debates, this could be seen as an ad hominem by implying she's the cause of the lack of leadership, thus attacking her competence. 

So the primary PD rule violation is the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) with Ad Hominem (2). The classification would be Ad Hominem (2). 

But wait, the statement doesn't directly attack her character but rather points to her as the source of the problem. That could be a form of ad hominem, specifically the "you did it first" (tu quoque) or bias ad hominem. However, the exact sub-type might not matter here. The main point is that the argument is attacking the person rather than the argument. 

So the answer would be Ad Hominem (2) as the primary fallacy.
