    "analysis": "The statement makes a specific claim about price increases during two administrations without providing evidence or data to support the assertion. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2), as the speaker presents the claim as self-evident without defending it. While the statement does not explicitly cite an authority, the phrasing 'We find that...' implies acceptance of the claim without justification, aligning with the Appeal to Authority (1) category. The primary violation is the failure to meet the burden of proof, which indirectly supports the Appeal to Authority fallacy by suggesting the claim is accepted without evidence.",
