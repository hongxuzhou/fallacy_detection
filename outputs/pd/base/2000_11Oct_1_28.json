    "analysis": "The statement 'And the \"Los Angeles Times\" spent a lot of ink going into that.' violates the FREEDOM RULE by attempting to discredit the opposing argument through an attack on the credibility of the Los Angeles Times as a source. By implying that the newspaper's extensive coverage is excessive or biased, the speaker shifts focus from the argument itself to the media's role, undermining the opponent's position without addressing the actual standpoint. This aligns with Ad Hominem (2), as it attacks the source's credibility rather than engaging with the argument's merits.",
