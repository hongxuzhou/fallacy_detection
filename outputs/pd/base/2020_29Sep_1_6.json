    "analysis": "The statement 'You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class' directly attacks the person's academic performance rather than addressing the actual argument they might be making. This violates the Standpoint Rule (3) by not engaging with the opponent's standpoint but instead distorting or attacking their personal history. The attack on the individual's past academic record (a personal characteristic) falls under Ad Hominem (2), as it shifts focus from the argument to the person's character. This violates the Freedom Rule (1) by attempting to discredit the opponent, but the primary classification is Ad Hominem (2) due to its direct personal attack.",
