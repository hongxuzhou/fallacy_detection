    "analysis": "The statement attacks the opponent's character ('all talk and no action') rather than addressing their actual arguments or policies. This violates the FREEDOM RULE by discrediting the opponent through personal insults (name-calling) instead of engaging with their standpoint. The attack is irrelevant to the substantive debate and aims to silence or undermine Joe's credibility without addressing his position.",
