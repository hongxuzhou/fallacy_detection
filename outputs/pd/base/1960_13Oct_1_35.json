    "analysis": "The statement cites the opinions of General Ridgway and Secretary Herter to support the speaker's stance on Quemoy and Matsu. This relies on the authority of these figures rather than presenting original reasoning or evidence. The speaker avoids defending their position independently, shifting the burden of proof to the opponent by implying their stance is validated by others' authority. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) and the Relevance Rule (Rule 4), as the argument lacks direct relevance to the issue and relies on unexamined authority. The primary violation maps to Appeal to Authority (1) because the argument hinges on the credibility of cited authorities without critical engagement.",
