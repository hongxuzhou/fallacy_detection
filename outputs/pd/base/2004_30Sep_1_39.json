    "analysis": "The statement 'Ask the people in the armed forces today' is a directive that implicitly relies on the authority of the armed forces to validate a claim without providing substantive evidence. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by shifting the responsibility to the other party to seek validation from an unspecified authority. The phrase 'Ask the people in the armed forces' functions as an appeal to authority (Output Category 1) by suggesting that the opinion of the armed forces is inherently credible without justification, thereby avoiding the need to defend the argument's premises. The primary violation is the Burden of Proof Rule, which maps to Appeal to Authority (1) as the statement evades providing evidence and instead relies on the perceived authority of a group.",
