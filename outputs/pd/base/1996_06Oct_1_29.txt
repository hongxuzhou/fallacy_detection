Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The statement is: "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." 

First, I need to check which Pragma-Dialectical rules are being violated. The user mentioned that the primary classification has to be one of the six categories. Let me go through each rule step by step.

Starting with the Freedom Rule. The statement doesn't seem to be silencing someone or using emotional pressure. So maybe not that. 

Next, Burden of Proof Rule. The speaker is presenting a claim (that the policy is bad for the economy) and then says that 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates agree. But does this violate the burden of proof? Well, the rule says that the party advancing a standpoint must defend it when asked. Here, the speaker is using the authority of economists as evidence, but maybe they're not actually providing the reasoning. However, the Burden of Proof violation is about evading by making claims self-evident. This might not be that directly.

Looking at the Relevance Rule. The argument is supposed to be relevant. But the statement is citing experts, which could be relevant. However, if the argument is just citing authority without providing the actual reasoning, that might be an appeal to authority. Wait, the Relevance Rule violation includes appeals to emotion or authority without proper reasoning. So maybe that's a violation here. 

Then the Argument Scheme Rule. The statement is using the authority of experts (Nobel laureates) to support the claim. This could be an appeal to authority, which is under the Output Category of Appeal to Authority (1). But wait, the Argument Scheme Rule mentions False Cause, Slippery Slope, etc. But the Appeal to Authority is a separate category. 

Wait, the Output Categories include Appeal to Authority (1). So if the statement is using the authority of experts without proper evidence, that's an Appeal to Authority. 

But let me check the PD rules again. The Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) mentions that misinterpreting correlation as causation is False Cause (3). But in this case, the statement is using the authority of experts. The Relevance Rule says that arguments must be relevant. But if the argument is just citing authorities without explaining why their opinion is relevant, that's an appeal to authority. 

So the primary PD rule violation here would be the Relevance Rule, because the argument is not providing relevant reasoning but instead relies on the authority of experts. However, the Output Category for Appeal to Authority (1) fits here. 

Alternatively, the Burden of Proof Rule: if the speaker is not providing evidence but instead relying on the authority of others, that could be shifting the burden of proof. But the Burden of Proof Rule violation is about evading by making claims self-evident. 

Wait, the statement is not necessarily making the claim self-evident. It's presenting the claim as supported by experts. So maybe the Burden of Proof isn't directly violated here. 

So the main issue is that the argument is relying on the authority of experts without providing the actual reasoning. That's an Appeal to Authority (1), which is one of the output categories. 

So the primary PD rule violation is the Relevance Rule (since the argument is not relevant but relies on authority), but the classification would be Appeal to Authority (1). 

Alternatively, the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) might be involved if the argument is using an inappropriate scheme. However, the Output Category for Appeal to Authority is separate. 

Therefore, the primary classification is Appeal to Authority (1).
