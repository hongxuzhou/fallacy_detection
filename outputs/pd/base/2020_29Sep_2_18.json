    "analysis": "The statement 'You don't have it in your blood' employs a personal attack by implying the opponent's inherent qualities (e.g., character, capability) are lacking, rather than addressing their actual argument. This violates the FREEDOM RULE by attempting to discredit the opponent through a generalized ad hominem attack (sub-type: name-calling/labeling). The phrase 'you don't have it in your blood' is a loaded label that undermines the opponent's right to speak or defend their position, rather than engaging with their standpoint. While the RELEVANCE RULE is marginally implicated, the primary violation lies in the Freedom Rule's prohibition against discrediting opponents through personal attacks. The statement also indirectly violates the STANDPOINT RULE by distorting the opponent's position into a character-based judgment.",
