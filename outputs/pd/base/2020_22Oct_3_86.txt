Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. The statement given is: "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." 

First, I need to understand what this statement is trying to convey. The speaker is saying that because the other person (he) hasn't said something (maybe a specific claim), they are "dying with it," which might be a metaphor for being in a bad situation. Then they mention that he said it's dangerous. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe there's a contradiction here? Let me parse it again.

The phrase "We're dying with it" could be an emotional appeal, suggesting that the situation is dire. The reason given is "because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." Maybe there's a misstatement here. Perhaps the speaker is trying to say that since the other person hasn't addressed something (maybe a specific issue), they are suffering, but then they mention that the other person did say it's dangerous. That seems contradictory. 

Now, applying the Pragma-Dialectical rules. Let's look at the rules. The primary issue here might be related to the relevance of the argument. The speaker is using emotional language ("dying with it") which could be an appeal to emotion. Also, the structure of the statement seems to be attacking the other person's position by implying that their lack of statement is a problem, but then they mention that the other person did say it's dangerous. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. 

Looking at the rules, the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) states that standpoints must be defended with relevant argumentation. Violations include irrelevant arguments, appeals to emotion, or authority without proper reasoning. The statement uses "dying with it" which is emotionally charged, possibly an appeal to emotion (Appeal to Emotion (0)). Also, the structure might be a Straw Man if they're distorting the opponent's position, but the main issue here seems to be the emotional language. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an Ad Hominem (2) if they're attacking the person's character or consistency. But the statement says "he's never said" which could be a distortion of the opponent's position, making it a Straw Man. However, the primary issue here is the emotional appeal. 

Wait, the statement starts with "We're dying with it," which is a strong emotional statement. The reason given is that "he's never said — he said it's dangerous." This seems like a contradiction. Maybe the speaker is trying to say that because the other person hasn't addressed something (maybe a specific claim), they are suffering, but then they mention that the other person did say it's dangerous. That might be a confusion or a misrepresentation. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using the emotional appeal ("dying with it") to evoke a strong reaction, which is an Appeal to Emotion (0). The rest of the statement might be trying to justify that emotion by pointing out that the other person's statements (saying it's dangerous) are being ignored. But the primary fallacy here is the emotional appeal. 

So, under the Relevance Rule (Rule 4), the use of emotional language without relevant reasoning would be a violation. Therefore, the primary fallacy would be Appeal to Emotion (0). 

Alternatively, if the statement is attacking the other person's position by implying that their lack of statement is a problem, that might be a Straw Man (which is under the Standpoint Rule, Rule 3). But the main issue here is the emotional language. 

I think the key here is the emotional appeal. The statement uses "dying with it" which is a strong emotional term, possibly to provoke a reaction. So, the primary fallacy is Appeal to Emotion (0). 

Let me check the Output Categories again. Appeal to Emotion (0) includes loaded language, which "dying with it" could be. So the classification would be 0.
