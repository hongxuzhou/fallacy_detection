    "analysis": "The statement employs emotionally charged labels ('wishy-washy,' 'flip-flopper') to attack the president's character rather than addressing substantive arguments. This violates the Freedom Rule (1) by attempting to discredit the opponent through personal attacks (Ad Hominem) and the Relevance Rule (4) by using irrelevant emotional language. However, the primary violation is Ad Hominem (2), as the speaker focuses on undermining the opponent's credibility through name-calling rather than engaging with their standpoint. The loaded terms and personal attacks serve to delegitimize the opponent's position without addressing the actual argument, which is a classic Ad Hominem fallacy.",
