    "analysis": "The statement cites numerous experts (Nobel laureates, economists, businesspeople) to support its economic ideas, but it fails to provide substantive reasoning or evidence linking these authorities to the specific claim. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by relying on irrelevant argumentation (appeal to authority) rather than addressing the standpoint with relevant premises. The primary fallacy is Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker shifts the burden of proof by implying credibility without substantive justification.",
