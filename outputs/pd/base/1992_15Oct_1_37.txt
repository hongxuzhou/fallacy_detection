Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze a specific statement from a presidential debate using pragma-dialectical argumentation. The task involves identifying the primary fallacy, classifying it, and providing a CoT analysis. 

First, I need to understand the statement: "I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go." 

Step 1: Detection. I need to check which PD rules are violated. The speaker is citing a lot of experts (Nobel laureates, economists, business people) to support their economic ideas. This seems like an appeal to authority. But wait, the PD rules mention Appeal to Authority (1) as a category. However, the PD rules also have the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2), which says that the party advancing a standpoint must defend it when asked. Here, the speaker is not providing arguments but instead relying on the authority of others. That might be a violation of the Burden of Proof Rule by shifting the burden to the other party. But the primary issue here is the use of authority without proper reasoning. 

Looking at the Output Fallacy Categories, Appeal to Authority (1) is when the arguer mentions an authority without relevant evidence. The speaker is listing many experts but not explaining how their ideas support the specific economic plan. So it's an appeal to authority. 

But wait, the PD rule 4 is Relevance Rule: Standpoints must be defended with relevant argumentation. The speaker is using irrelevant arguments (appealing to authority) without proper reasoning. That's a violation of Rule 4. However, the Output Category for Appeal to Authority (1) is separate. 

Wait, the user's Output Categories include Appeal to Authority (1), which is when the arguer mentions an authority without providing relevant evidence. The statement here is using the authority of experts but not explaining how their endorsement supports the claim. So it's an appeal to authority. 

But the PD rules also mention that the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) is violated if the speaker shifts the burden to the other party. However, the primary violation here is using authority without proper reasoning, which is Appeal to Authority (1). 

So, the primary PD rule violation is Rule 4 (Relevance Rule), because the argument is not relevant. But the Output Category is Appeal to Authority (1). 

Wait, the Output Categories are separate from the PD rules. The user says to classify into one of the 6 Output Categories. The PD rules are the basis for identifying the fallacy. 

So, the main issue here is that the speaker is not providing arguments but is relying on the authority of experts. That's an Appeal to Authority (1). 

But according to the PD rules, the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) says that the party must defend their standpoint when asked. Here, the speaker is not providing arguments but instead citing authorities, which is shifting the burden. However, the Output Category for that would be Appeal to Authority (1). 

Alternatively, the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) is violated because the argument is irrelevant. But the Output Category for that is Appeal to Emotion (0) or Appeal to Authority (1). 

The key here is that the speaker is using the authority of experts as support, which is a classic appeal to authority. Therefore, the primary fallacy is Appeal to Authority (1). 

So, the classification would be 1. 

I need to make sure that this is the primary fallacy. The statement is not using emotional language, so not Appeal to Emotion (0). It's not a straw man, so not Ad Hominem (2). It's not a slippery slope or false cause. The main issue is the appeal to authority. 

Therefore, the answer should be Appeal to Authority (1).
