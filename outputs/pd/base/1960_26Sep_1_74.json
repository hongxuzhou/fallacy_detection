    "analysis": "The statement avoids taking credit for the price line's stability, shifting the burden of proof to the listener by not providing evidence for the committee's effectiveness. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by evading the need to defend the claim that the committee's formation led to the price line being held. The speaker's vague attribution of success to the committee without substantiation aligns with the False Cause (3) fallacy, as it implies a causal link between the committee's formation and the outcome without establishing a logical connection.",
