Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The statement given is "I want to get America's economy going again." First, I need to apply the Pragma-Dialectical rules to see which one is violated. 

Starting with the Detection step. The statement is a vague expression of intent. It doesn't provide specific arguments or evidence for how the economy will be improved. The speaker is making a claim about wanting to revive the economy but isn't explaining the methods or providing reasoning. 

Looking at the PD rules, the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) says that a party must defend their standpoint when asked. This statement doesn't offer any supporting arguments or premises. It's a claim without justification. Also, the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) requires that standpoints be defended with relevant argumentation. The statement is too vague and doesn't address the actual issues or provide relevant points. 

However, the primary violation seems to be the Burden of Proof Rule. The speaker is making a claim but doesn't defend it, which is a violation. But wait, the Output Categories include Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), etc. 

Wait, the statement doesn't use emotional language or appeal to authority. It's more about the lack of argumentation. However, the Output Categories don't have a category for "vagueness" directly. The closest might be Appeal to Emotion if the statement is meant to evoke a feeling, but "get America's economy going again" is more of a vague promise. 

Alternatively, maybe the Burden of Proof Rule violation isn't directly mapped to the Output Categories. Let me check the Output Categories again. The categories are Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), Ad Hominem (2), False Cause (3), Slippery Slope (4), Slogans (5). 

The statement is a slogan, a brief phrase that's meant to provoke excitement. It's a catchy phrase that doesn't provide substance. So maybe it's a Slogan (5). The Slogans category is for brief, striking phrases used to provoke excitement, often with repetition. The statement is a slogan that's vague and doesn't offer real arguments, just a promise. 

But the primary PD rule violation here is the Burden of Proof Rule because the speaker isn't providing evidence. However, the Output Categories don't have a category for that. So the closest is Slogans (5) because it's a vague, emotionally charged phrase without substance. Alternatively, maybe Appeal to Emotion (0) if the language is meant to evoke feelings about the economy. 

But the statement itself doesn't use emotional language, just a general statement. So perhaps Slogans (5) is the best fit. The statement is a slogan that's meant to be memorable and evoke a positive feeling about the economy, without providing specific arguments. Therefore, the primary fallacy would be Slogans (5).
