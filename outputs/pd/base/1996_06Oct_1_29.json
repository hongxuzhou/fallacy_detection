    "analysis": "The statement cites the authority of 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates to support the claim that a policy is bad for the economy. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by relying on appeals to authority without providing relevant, substantive reasoning. While the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) could be invoked for misusing expert opinion, the primary violation aligns with the Output Category 'Appeal to Authority (1)' because the argument attempts to validate the claim by referencing the authority of experts rather than addressing the actual merits of the policy. The statement fails to meet the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by not defending the claim with evidence, but the most direct and clear violation is the appeal to authority.",
