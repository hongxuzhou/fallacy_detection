    "analysis": "The statement attempts to link the number of killings in Chicago to Barack Obama's presidency, implying a causal relationship without providing evidence. This violates the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by misinterpreting correlation as causation. The speaker assumes that the timing of the killings (since Obama's presidency) directly caused the violence, ignoring other potential factors. This misrepresents the causal relationship, fitting the False Cause (3) category.",
