    "analysis": "The statement uses a rhetorical question directed at the audience to evoke an emotional response about their economic status without providing evidence or logical reasoning. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by substituting argumentation with emotional pressure. The phrasing 'are you better off' implicitly pressures viewers to self-reflect emotionally rather than engage in substantive debate. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as it exploits the audience's subjective experience to sway opinion without addressing the actual argument.",
