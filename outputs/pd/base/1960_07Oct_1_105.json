    "analysis": "The statement 'We have to practice what we preach' is a concise, memorable phrase that serves as a moral imperative. While it may appear to be a general principle, its use in a debate context often functions as a slogan to provoke emotional resonance and rally support. This aligns with the Slogans (5) category, as it is a brief, striking phrase designed to evoke excitement and align with the audience's values without directly addressing the opponent's standpoint or providing substantive argumentation. The primary PD rule violation is the Relevance Rule (Rule 4), as the statement may divert attention from the actual issue at hand, relying on emotional appeal rather than logical engagement. However, the most appropriate classification is Slogans (5) due to its structured use as a rhetorical device to provoke audience reaction.",
