    "analysis": "The statement accuses Mr. Carter of inconsistency by contrasting his prior promise with his later policy. This attacks his credibility rather than engaging with the substance of his economic arguments. The primary violation is the Freedom Rule (Rule 1), as it attempts to undermine his right to speak by discrediting his actions. This aligns with Ad Hominem (2) because it focuses on personal inconsistency rather than addressing the argument itself. While the statement cites factual policy changes, the framing shifts from a factual critique to an ad hominem attack on Carter's character, violating the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3) by not engaging with his actual standpoint. However, the primary classification is Ad Hominem (2) as it directly attacks the person's consistency, which is a sub-type of the Freedom Rule violation.",
