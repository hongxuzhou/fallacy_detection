    "analysis": "The statement attempts to undermine the opponent's tax scheme by citing a campaign co-chair's assertion about Medicare cuts. However, it fails to provide direct evidence linking the tax scheme to those cuts, relying instead on an authority figure's statement without establishing its relevance or reliability. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by using an argument from authority without proper reasoning. The appeal to authority (Output Category 1) is the primary fallacy because the speaker shifts the burden of proof by relying on a third party's claim rather than addressing the actual argument.",
