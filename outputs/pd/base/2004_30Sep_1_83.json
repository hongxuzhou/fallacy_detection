    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('enormous pressure', 'cannot wilt') to evoke fear and concern about the president's ability to handle stress, thereby influencing the audience's emotional response rather than engaging in a logical argument. This violates the Language Use Rule (Rule 10) by employing loaded phrases to exploit emotional instincts. While the statement could be interpreted as a causal claim, the primary issue is the emotional manipulation, which aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0).",
