    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('deeply') to evoke a strong reaction about the issue's divisive nature without providing relevant evidence or logical reasoning. This violates the Relevance Rule by substituting substantive argumentation with emotional appeal. The phrase 'divides Americans deeply' employs loaded language to manipulate emotional responses rather than engaging in a rational discussion of the issue's merits. This aligns with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category, as it exploits emotional instincts to influence the audience's stance.",
