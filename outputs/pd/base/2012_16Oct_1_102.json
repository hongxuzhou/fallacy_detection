    "analysis": "The statement 'If I become president, I'll get America working again' is a vague, emotionally charged promise that lacks specific evidence or reasoning. It violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by presenting a claim as self-evident without defending it. Additionally, the phrase 'get America working again' is ambiguous and emotionally loaded, violating the Language Use Rule (Rule 10). However, the primary classification focuses on the use of a concise, striking phrase designed to provoke emotional response, aligning with the Slogans (5) category.",
