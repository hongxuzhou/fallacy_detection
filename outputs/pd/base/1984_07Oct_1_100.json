    "analysis": "The statement asserts a belief about the party platform's specifications for judicial appointments without providing evidence or justification for the claim. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule, as the speaker advances a standpoint (that the platform only requires respecting human life) without defending it when asked. While the statement is phrased as a personal belief, the absence of supporting evidence or reasoning for the claim about the platform's content creates an evasion of the burden of proof. The closest Output Category is Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker implicitly relies on the party platform as an authority without substantiating its specific requirements.",
