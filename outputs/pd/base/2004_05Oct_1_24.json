    "analysis": "The statement references George Tenet's testimony as a point of contention but does not provide evidence or defend the relevance of the testimony to the argument. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (2) by evading the responsibility to justify the claim. However, the most appropriate classification from the Output Categories is Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker implicitly relies on Tenet's position as an authority without substantiating the claim. The statement shifts the burden of proof by citing an authority figure's testimony without addressing the validity or relevance of the argument itself.",
