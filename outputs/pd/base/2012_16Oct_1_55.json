    "analysis": "The statement is a policy goal presented as a rhetorical slogan, emphasizing emotional appeal through repetition and loaded language. While it does not directly violate a specific PD rule, the structure and intent align with the use of a slogan to provoke audience excitement. The repetition of 'for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business' serves as a mnemonic device, prioritizing memorability and emotional resonance over substantive argumentation. This aligns with the Slogans (5) category as it uses a striking phrase to engage the audience emotionally, bypassing deeper critical discussion.",
