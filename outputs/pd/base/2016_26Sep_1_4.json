    "analysis": "The statement attacks Donald's personal circumstances (starting with $14 million from his father) to dismiss his argument about wealth distribution, rather than addressing the merits of his stance. This violates the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3) by distorting or avoiding the actual argument, and the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by undermining his credibility through personal attacks. The primary violation is Ad Hominem (2), as the speaker attacks Donald's character/privilege rather than engaging with his policy argument.",
