    "analysis": "The statement presents a quote from President Kennedy as a rhetorical assertion without providing substantive reasoning or argumentation. While the quote itself is a historical reference, its use in the context of critical discussion lacks the necessary logical structure or evidence to support a standpoint. This falls under the Relevance Rule violation (irrelevant arguments) because the statement does not engage in relevant argumentation. However, the most direct classification is as a Slogan (5) since it is a brief, striking phrase designed to provoke emotional resonance rather than a reasoned defense of a standpoint.",
