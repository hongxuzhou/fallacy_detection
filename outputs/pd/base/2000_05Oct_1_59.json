    "analysis": "The statement uses a personal anecdote to illustrate racial injustice, but the emotional weight of the narrative is prioritized over logical argumentation. The phrase 'surrounded by police for no other cause than the color of his skin' employs loaded language to evoke strong emotional reactions, which distracts from substantive reasoning. This violates the Relevance Rule by substituting emotional appeal for relevant argumentation, and the Language Use Rule by using emotionally charged phrasing. However, the primary classification falls under Appeal to Emotion (0) as the core issue is exploiting emotional instincts to advance the argument rather than engaging in rational discourse.",
