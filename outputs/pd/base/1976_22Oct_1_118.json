    "analysis": "The statement invokes the authority of the president, Congress, and the people as a basis for a claim about the nation's greatness without providing substantive reasoning or evidence. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by shifting the responsibility to the opposing party to disprove the claim rather than defending it. It also violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by relying on an appeal to authority rather than relevant argumentation. The primary violation maps to the Appeal to Authority (1) category, as the speaker cites the authority of institutional figures without substantiating the claim with logical or empirical support.",
