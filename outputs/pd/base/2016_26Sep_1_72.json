{
    "analysis": "The statement uses hyperbolic language ('230 years' worth of debt') to evoke an emotional response, which is a clear appeal to emotion. The comparison is irrelevant to the actual debt figures and serves to manipulate the audience's perception through fear rather than presenting logical, relevant evidence. This violates the Relevance Rule (4) by introducing an emotionally charged, non-sequitur comparison. The primary fallacy is an Appeal to Emotion (0) because the argument relies on emotional manipulation rather than factual reasoning.",
