    "analysis": "The statement implies that allowing unions and management to seek government intervention in disputes will inevitably lead to undesirable outcomes like wage and price controls. This assumes a direct causal chain from the initial action (government involvement) to extreme consequences (wage/price control) without addressing intermediate steps or evidence of such a progression. This violates the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by omitting necessary premises in the causal chain, fitting the definition of a Slippery Slope fallacy.",
