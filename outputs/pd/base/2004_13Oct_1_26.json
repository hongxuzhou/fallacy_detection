    "analysis": "The statement cites the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as a source to support the claim that the president's plan would create a $2 trillion deficit in Social Security. While the CBO is a reputable, bipartisan institution, the speaker does not engage in critical analysis of the CBO's methodology or reasoning behind the findings. Instead, they present the CBO's conclusion as an unchallengeable authority, shifting the burden of proof to the opposing side. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2), as the speaker relies on the CBO's authority without defending their own standpoint with independent reasoning. This aligns with the Appeal to Authority (1) fallacy, as the argument hinges on the credibility of the CBO rather than providing substantive evidence or addressing counterarguments.",
