    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('rapists and criminals') to evoke a negative emotional response, which is not directly relevant to the actual argument being discussed. This violates the Relevance Rule (4) by appealing to emotion rather than addressing the logical merits of the argument. The loaded terms are intended to discredit the opponent's position through emotional manipulation, fitting the Appeal to Emotion (0) category.",
