    "analysis": "The statement compares economic performance under different administrations without providing evidence or context for the claims. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by asserting unverified claims as self-evident. While the statement does not directly use emotional language or appeal to authority, the lack of evidence could be interpreted as an appeal to emotion by implying the administration's policies caused economic decline, exploiting the audience's emotional response to economic hardship. The primary violation is the failure to defend claims, which indirectly aligns with the Appeal to Emotion category by leveraging emotional reactions to unproven assertions.",
