Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." First, I need to check against the Pragma-Dialectical rules. 

Starting with the Detection step. What's problematic here? The statement seems like a general assertion. Maybe it's a slogan? Let me think. The statement is a bit of a clich√©, often used to emphasize keeping promises. But in a debate context, does it violate any rules?

Looking at the rules, the Language Use Rule (10) mentions vagueness or ambiguity. But the statement isn't ambiguous. It's a clear statement. Maybe the Burden of Proof Rule? The speaker is asserting a general principle without providing evidence. But the Burden of Proof Rule violation is about evading proof. However, the statement is a general claim, not a specific claim that needs proof. 

Wait, the Output Fallacy Categories include Slogans (5), which are brief phrases used to provoke excitement. The statement is a slogan, a catchy phrase. But does it fit into a PD rule violation? The Language Use Rule isn't violated here. Maybe the Starting Point Rule? If the speaker is presenting a premise as a starting point without justification. But the statement is a general principle, not necessarily an unproven starting point. 

Alternatively, maybe the Relevance Rule? If the statement is irrelevant to the actual discussion. But the problem is that the statement is a general assertion without supporting arguments. However, the primary issue here is that it's a slogan used to evoke a reaction rather than a substantive argument. 

In the Output Categories, Slogans (5) are a category. The statement is a slogan, so classification would be 5. But is there a PD rule violation that leads to that? The Language Use Rule isn't directly violated. However, if the statement is used to bypass argumentation, maybe the Burden of Proof Rule? But the statement is a general principle, not a claim that needs proof. 

Alternatively, maybe the Argument Scheme Rule (8), which includes things like hasty generalization or false cause. But the statement isn't making a causal claim. 

Wait, the statement is a general principle, but in a debate, if someone uses it without justification, they might be evading the burden of proof. But the Burden of Proof Rule violation is when a party presents a claim as self-evident. However, the statement is a principle, not a specific claim. 

Alternatively, maybe the Starting Point Rule (6), which says you can't present premises as accepted without justification. If the statement is being used as an unproven starting point, then it's begging the question. But the statement itself is a principle, not a premise. 

Alternatively, the Relevance Rule (4) if the statement is irrelevant. But the problem is that it's a slogan, not an irrelevant argument. 

Hmm, maybe the primary issue is that it's a slogan, which is an Output Category 5. The PD rule that might be violated is the Argument Scheme Rule (8), where the argument is a slogan. But the Argument Scheme Rule includes things like Slippery Slope, False Cause, etc. Slogans aren't explicitly listed in the PD rules. 

Wait, the Output Categories include Slogans (5), so if the statement is a slogan, then the classification is 5. The PD rule that's violated here might be the Language Use Rule (10) if it's vague, but it's not. Alternatively, the Relevance Rule if it's irrelevant. But the statement itself is a general principle. 

Alternatively, the Burden of Proof Rule: if the speaker is asserting a general principle without proof, but that's more of a burden of proof violation. However, the Output Category for that would be Appeal to Authority (1) if they cite an authority, but here it's not. 

Wait, the statement "A promise made will be a promise kept" is a general principle. If used in a debate without supporting arguments, it might be a case of not meeting the burden of proof. But the Burden of Proof Rule violation is when the party shifts the burden. However, the statement is a general claim, not a specific one. 

Alternatively, maybe the Argument Scheme Rule (8) if it's a hasty generalization. But the statement isn't making a generalization from specific cases. 

I think the key here is that the statement is a slogan, which is a brief, striking phrase used to provoke excitement. That fits the Slogans (5) category. The PD rule that's violated here is the Argument Scheme Rule (8) if the argument is using a slogan as an argument scheme. But the Argument Scheme Rule includes things like Slippery Slope, False Cause, etc. Slogans aren't explicitly listed there. 

Alternatively, the Language Use Rule (10) if the statement is vague. But the statement is clear. 

Wait, the Output Categories include Slogans (5), so if the statement is a slogan, then the primary classification is 5. The PD rule that's violated would be the Argument Scheme Rule (8) if the argument is using a slogan as an argument. But the PD rules don't directly mention slogans. However, the Slogans category is an Output Category, so the primary classification is 5. 

Therefore, the answer would be classification 5 (Slogans). The PD rule violation is the Argument Scheme Rule (8) because the statement is a slogan used as an argument without proper reasoning. But the primary classification is Slogans (5).
