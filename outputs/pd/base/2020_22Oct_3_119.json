{
    "analysis": "The statement 'Our character is on the ballot' emphasizes moral character as a decisive factor in elections. While not explicitly attacking an opponent, it uses emotionally charged language ('character') to frame the debate around personal traits rather than policy. This appeals to the audience's emotional instincts, shifting focus from substantive arguments to subjective judgments. The violation lies in the **Relevance Rule** (Rule 4), as the argument relies on emotional language rather than relevant, evidence-based reasoning. This aligns with the **Appeal to Emotion (0)** category, as the statement employs loaded language to exploit emotional responses.",
