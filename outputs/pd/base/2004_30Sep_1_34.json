    "analysis": "The statement 'I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead' relies on the opinion of the American people as a justification for the speaker's belief in their victory. This violates the Relevance Rule by using an appeal to authority (the American people) without providing evidence to support the claim that their knowledge of leadership equates to an ability to win. The argument assumes the American people's belief is sufficient proof, which is a classic appeal to authority. The primary PD rule violation is the Argument Scheme Rule, as the reasoning misinterprets the correlation between public opinion and leadership capability as causation. This maps to the 'Appeal to Authority' category because the speaker cites a group (the American people) as an authority without substantiating their expertise or the validity of their judgment.",
