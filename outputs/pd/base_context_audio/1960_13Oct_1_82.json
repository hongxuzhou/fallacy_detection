    "analysis": "The statement criticizes the opponent's economic policy by linking it to past inflation under Truman, using emotional language to evoke negative associations. This violates the Relevance Rule (PD Rule 4) by introducing an irrelevant historical comparison to appeal to emotion rather than addressing the policy's merits. The emotional appeal to Truman's era (a loaded reference) falls under Appeal to Emotion (0), as it exploits the audience's emotional instinct to discredit the policy without substantive reasoning.",
