    "analysis": "The statement uses a rhetorical question to emotionally engage the audience, shifting focus from objective data to personal experience. This appeals to the audience's emotions by framing the issue as a personal matter, bypassing logical argumentation. The speaker's emotional tone and the question's phrasing exploit the audience's subjective feelings rather than addressing the actual standpoint with relevant evidence. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by prioritizing emotional appeal over logical reasoning, classifying as an Appeal to Emotion (0).",
