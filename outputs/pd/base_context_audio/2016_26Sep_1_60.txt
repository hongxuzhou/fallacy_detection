Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. The user wants me to identify the primary fallacy in the given statement using pragma-dialectical rules. First, I need to understand the statement and the context provided.

The statement is from a 2016 presidential debate, and the speaker is talking about crime in Chicago, specifically mentioning 3,000 shootings and 4,000 deaths under Obama's presidency. They argue that stop-and-frisk is necessary. The context includes the speaker's mention of felons and the need for law and order in inner cities, targeting African-American and Hispanic communities.

Now, looking at the Pragma-Dialectical rules. The main issue here seems to be the emotional tone and the way the speaker is framing the argument. Let me check each rule. 

Rule 1: Freedom Rule. The speaker is not directly attacking the opponent but is using emotional language. However, there's no clear ad hominem or silencing here. Maybe not this one.

Rule 4: Relevance Rule. The argument uses emotional appeals, like mentioning the high number of shootings to evoke fear. That's an appeal to emotion (0) under the output categories. But wait, the statement also mentions specific numbers. Are those relevant? The numbers are presented to support the need for stop-and-frisk, but are they relevant? Maybe not directly, but the emotional impact is the key here.

Rule 2: Burden of Proof. The speaker is asserting a claim (stop-and-frisk is needed) but doesn't provide evidence beyond the statistics. However, the main issue might not be about burden of proof but about the emotional appeal.

Rule 8: Argument Scheme. The speaker might be using a slippery slope if they imply that without stop-and-frisk, things will get worse. But the statement doesn't mention a chain of events leading to an extreme outcome. It's more about the current situation.

Rule 10: Language Use. The statement uses emotionally charged language like "bad people" and "unfair," which could be loaded language, fitting under Appeal to Emotion (0).

Looking at the output categories, Appeal to Emotion (0) includes loaded language. The speaker uses "bad people" and mentions the high number of shootings to evoke fear and pity, which is an emotional appeal. The numbers are presented to create a sense of urgency, but the argument doesn't provide a logical connection between the numbers and the necessity of stop-and-frisk. This is more about emotional impact than logical reasoning, so it's an appeal to emotion.

Another possible angle: Ad Hominem (2) if the speaker attacks the opponent's character, but the statement doesn't directly attack the opponent. Instead, it's targeting the policy and the demographics affected. So Ad Hominem might not apply here.

Therefore, the primary fallacy is Appeal to Emotion (0) due to the use of emotionally charged language and statistics to evoke fear, which is a violation of the Relevance Rule (4) by using irrelevant emotional appeals instead of logical argumentation. However, according to the output categories, Appeal to Emotion (0) is the correct classification here.
