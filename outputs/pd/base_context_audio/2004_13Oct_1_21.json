    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('in their guts know') to bypass logical reasoning, appealing to the audience's instincts rather than providing evidence. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by substituting emotional appeal for relevant argumentation. The phrase 'in their guts know' employs loaded language (emotional intensity) to evoke a visceral response, fitting the 'Appeal to Emotion' category (0). While the tone suggests high arousal, the primary fallacy lies in using unverified emotional intuition as a substitute for logical defense.",
