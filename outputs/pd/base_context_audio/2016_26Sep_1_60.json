    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('bad people', 'unfair') and cites statistics to evoke fear and moral outrage, which is a clear appeal to emotion. The speaker frames the issue as a moral imperative for law and order, bypassing logical argumentation. This violates the Relevance Rule (4) by prioritizing emotional appeals over relevant, evidence-based reasoning. The loaded language ('bad people') and focus on victim demographics ('African-American and Hispanic people') exploit emotional instincts rather than addressing the policy argument directly. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the primary fallacy.",
