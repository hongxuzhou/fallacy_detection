    "analysis": "The statement attacks Secretary Clinton's leadership ability directly, shifting focus from policy discussion to personal criticism. This violates the FREEDOM RULE (Rule 1) by attempting to discredit her rather than addressing the argument. The emotional tone and personal attack align with Ad Hominem (2), as the speaker undermines Clinton's credibility without engaging with the actual standpoint. While the emotional language could hint at Appeal to Emotion (0), the primary violation is the direct personal attack, which is a textbook Ad Hominem (2) fallacy.",
