    "analysis": "The statement 'A promise made will be a promise kept' is used in a context where the speaker reassures voters about Social Security promises while addressing emotional concerns. The speaker's emotional tone (high arousal, dominance, valence) suggests an attempt to manipulate the audience's emotions rather than engage in logical argumentation. The statement is a general principle, but its application here is framed to evoke trust and fear, aligning with an appeal to emotion. The primary PD violation is the **Relevance Rule**, as the statement is used to emotionally sway voters rather than provide relevant, evidence-based reasoning. This maps to **Appeal to Emotion (0)**, as the argument relies on emotional language to influence the audience's stance.",
