    "analysis": "The statement cites past military leaders' opinions to support the current stance on treaty commitments. While the quotes are relevant to the topic, the speaker relies on these authorities without providing original reasoning, shifting the burden of proof to the opponent. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by evading direct defense of their standpoint. However, the most fitting Output Category is Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker uses the authority of past figures to bolster their argument without sufficient evidence, aligning with the definition of appealing to non-expert or popular authority.",
