    "analysis": "The statement 'If I become president, I'll get America working again' is a vague promise that lacks specific reasoning or evidence. While the speaker uses emotionally charged language ('get America working again') to evoke a strong response, the primary issue lies in the **Language Use Rule (Rule 10)**, which requires clear and unambiguous formulations. The phrase is overly vague and lacks concrete details, making it a **slogan** (Output Category 5) due to its brevity and emotionally striking nature. However, the emotional appeal (e.g., 'working again') also aligns with **Appeal to Emotion (0)**. Between these, the **primary PD violation** is the **Language Use Rule**, but since this isn't an output category, the closest match is **Slogans (5)**, as the statement is a brief, emotionally charged phrase designed to provoke excitement without substantive argumentation.",
