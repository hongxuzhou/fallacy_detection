    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('mortgaged your children's futures', 'trust us') to evoke fear and responsibility, which is a classic appeal to emotion. This violates the Relevance Rule (4) by prioritizing emotional manipulation over logical argumentation. The speaker's emphasis on trust and fear of future consequences distracts from substantive policy discussion, aligning with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category.",
