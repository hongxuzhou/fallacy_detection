Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. The user provided a statement from a political debate, and I need to apply pragma-dialectical argumentation analysis to identify the primary fallacy. 

First, I'll start with the CONTEXT CHECK. The statement is from a 1996 debate, likely between presidential candidates. The speaker is making a claim about economic impact, citing 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates. The tone is emotional, which might hint at an appeal to emotion. But I need to focus only on the statement itself, not the context.

Moving to STEP 1: DETECTION. The key part of the statement is "500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." This seems like an appeal to authority because the speaker is citing experts to support their claim. But wait, the PD rules mention Appeal to Authority (1) as a category. However, I should check if this violates any of the PD rules. 

Looking at the PD rules, the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) says that the party advancing a standpoint must defend it when asked. Here, the speaker is using the authority of economists without providing their actual arguments. That could be a violation of the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) if the argument isn't relevant. Alternatively, the Appeal to Authority is a fallacy if the authority isn't properly cited or if the argument relies solely on the authority's name. 

But the main issue here might be the Appeal to Authority (1) because the speaker is using the prestige of Nobel laureates without presenting their specific arguments. The statement doesn't provide the actual reasoning from the economists, just their titles. That's a classic appeal to authority. 

However, another angle: the statement might be using an ad hominem if it's attacking the opponents' credibility. But the statement isn't attacking the person but rather citing experts. So that's probably not Ad Hominem (2). 

The primary PD rule violation here is likely the Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker is relying on the authority of the economists without proper argumentation. This falls under the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) because the argument isn't relevant if the experts' opinions aren't properly cited or if the argument is based solely on their authority. But the Output Categories have Appeal to Authority as category 1. 

Wait, the Output Categories include Appeal to Authority (1) as a category. The statement is using the authority of economists and Nobel laureates to support the claim, which is a classic appeal to authority. So the primary fallacy would be Appeal to Authority (1). 

But I should check if there's another possible fallacy. The speaker mentions "everybody who's looked at it" which might be a hasty generalization (Slippery Slope or Hasty Generalization?), but the main point is the appeal to authority. 

So, the primary violation is the Appeal to Authority (1) because the argument relies on the authority of the economists without providing their actual arguments. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by using irrelevant authority without proper reasoning. However, the Output Category for this is Appeal to Authority (1). 

Therefore, the classification is 1 (Appeal to Authority). The justification is that the speaker cites experts without providing their specific arguments, relying on their authority rather than the merits of the argument itself. This violates the Relevance Rule by using an irrelevant appeal to authority instead of relevant evidence.
