    "analysis": "The statement 'Our character is on the ballot' uses emotionally charged language to emphasize moral superiority, leveraging the speaker's high arousal and dominance tone to sway the audience. This violates the Relevance Rule by shifting focus from policy to emotional appeal, which is classified as an Appeal to Emotion (0). The emotional framing distracts from substantive debate, exploiting the audience's emotional instincts rather than addressing the actual standpoint.",
