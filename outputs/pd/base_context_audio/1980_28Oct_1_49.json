    "analysis": "The statement references Reagan's 'voodoo economics' label from his running mate to discredit the opposing proposal, which is a form of name-calling. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by attacking the proposal's credibility through a derogatory label rather than addressing its merits. The use of 'voodoo economics' as a pejorative term discredits the standpoint without engaging with its arguments, fitting the Ad Hominem (2) fallacy. While the speaker cites inflation data, the primary issue is the emotional dismissal of the opponent's policy via a loaded label.",
