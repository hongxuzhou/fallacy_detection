    "analysis": "The statement presents a factual comparison of economic growth percentages between two administrations. However, the speaker's context includes a shift to emotional language by focusing on the 'average family,' which is a common tactic in political rhetoric to evoke emotional responses. This aligns with the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) violation, as the argument uses emotional appeals (appeal to emotion) rather than purely factual or logical reasoning. The emotional tone (high arousal, dominance) and the focus on personal impact ('you') suggest an attempt to sway the audience through sentiment rather than objective evidence.",
