    "analysis": "The statement attacks the opponent's academic credentials by claiming they graduated near the bottom of their class, which is a personal attack rather than addressing their argument. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by discrediting the opponent's competence through ad hominem tactics. The emotional tone (high dominance and arousal) reinforces the aggressive personal attack, which is a classic Ad Hominem (2) fallacy. While the statement could involve emotional appeals, the primary violation is the direct attack on the opponent's character, not the argument itself.",
