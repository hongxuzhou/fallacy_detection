Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to analyze the given statement using pragma-dialectical argumentation. First, I need to understand the statement and the context. The statement is from a 1988 presidential debate, and the speaker is talking about tax collection and deficit reduction. The specific statement is: "It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected."

Starting with Step 0: Context Check. The context mentions that the speaker is discussing bringing down interest rates, collecting taxes, and suggesting domestic cuts. The tone is emotional with high arousal and dominance. The statement is part of a larger argument about tax collection and spending. The key here is to focus only on the statement itself, not the surrounding context.

Moving to Step 1: Detection. I need to check which PD rule is violated. The statement is arguing that it's unfair for taxpayers to have their money uncollected. The speaker is addressing the fairness of tax collection. Now, looking at the PD rules, the Relevance Rule states that standpoints must be defended with relevant argumentation. The statement seems to be making an emotional appeal about fairness. The phrase "very unfair" might be an emotional appeal. Also, the speaker is talking about the average taxpayer, which could be an appeal to emotion, trying to evoke sympathy or anger.

Looking at the possible violations: The Relevance Rule (Rule 4) says that arguments must be relevant. If the speaker is using emotional language to make the argument more persuasive rather than providing relevant reasons, that's a violation. The statement is not providing evidence that the taxes are uncollected or why it's unfair, just stating it's unfair. That could be an appeal to emotion, which falls under the Appeal to Emotion category (0).

Step 2: Classification. The primary violation here seems to be the Relevance Rule, as the argument is not based on relevant premises but on emotional appeal. According to the Output Categories, Appeal to Emotion (0) includes loaded language and emotional pressure. The statement uses "very unfair" and refers to the average taxpayer, which is emotionally charged. So the classification would be Appeal to Emotion (0).

Step 3: Justification. The statement violates the Relevance Rule by using emotional language instead of providing relevant arguments. The phrase "very unfair" is an emotional appeal, which is a sub-category of Appeal to Emotion. The speaker is trying to evoke the audience's emotions about fairness rather than presenting logical reasons why the taxes should be collected. This makes the argument less relevant to the actual issue of tax collection and more about emotional response, thus fitting the Appeal to Emotion category.
