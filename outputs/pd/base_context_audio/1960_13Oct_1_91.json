    "analysis": "The statement argues that allowing government intervention in labor disputes will inevitably lead to wage and price controls, implying a direct causal link without addressing intermediate steps. This violates the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by suggesting an unlikely exaggerated outcome (wage/price control) through an implied chain of events (government settlement). The reasoning omits critical steps, fitting the Slippery Slope fallacy (4). While emotional tone is present, the primary violation lies in the flawed causal reasoning structure.",
