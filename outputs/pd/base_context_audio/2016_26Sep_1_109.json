    "analysis": "The statement 'I want to make America great again' is a slogan designed to provoke emotional resonance and rally support. While it may not explicitly violate a specific pragma-dialectical rule, its primary issue lies in its function as a slogan. Slogans are brief, emotionally charged phrases used to evoke excitement or urgency, often bypassing detailed argumentation. This aligns with Output Category 5 (Slogans) as it prioritizes rhetorical impact over clarity or logical defense. The phrase 'make America great again' is vague and lacks specificity, violating the Language Use Rule (Rule 10) by being ambiguous. However, the primary classification focuses on its role as a slogan, which is a deliberate rhetorical strategy to bypass critical discussion.",
