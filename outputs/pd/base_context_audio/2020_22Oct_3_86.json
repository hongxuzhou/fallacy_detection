    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('dying with it') to evoke fear and imply danger, which is a clear appeal to emotion. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by substituting emotional language for relevant argumentation. The speaker's tone (high arousal, dominance) reinforces this tactic, avoiding substantive evidence. While the statement also contains ambiguity (contradictory claims about 'he said'), the primary violation is the emotional manipulation to bypass logical reasoning.",
