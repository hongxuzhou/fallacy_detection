    "analysis": "The statement attacks Donald Trump's character by implying he 'rooted for the housing crisis,' which is a personal attack rather than addressing the policy arguments. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by discrediting Trump's position through ad hominem tactics. The emotional tone and loaded language ('perfect storm') may suggest appeal to emotion, but the primary violation is the direct attack on Trump's character, classifying it as Ad Hominem (2).",
