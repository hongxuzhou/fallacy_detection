    "analysis": "The statement 'You don't have it in your blood' is a direct personal attack on Joe Biden's character and heritage, which is a classic example of an ad hominem fallacy. The speaker avoids addressing Biden's actual arguments or qualifications, instead focusing on undermining his personal attributes. This violates the STANDPOINT RULE by not engaging with the actual standpoint and instead distorting it through personal attacks. The emotional tone and use of loaded language ('blood') further align with the Ad Hominem (2) category, as it aims to discredit the opponent's credibility rather than refute their claims.",
