    "analysis": "The statement cites a large number of experts (Nobel laureates, economists, businesspeople) to support the speaker's economic ideas. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by relying on irrelevant argumentation (appeal to authority) rather than substantive reasoning. While the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) is partially relevant, the primary violation is the use of unqualified authority without addressing the actual argument. This maps to the Appeal to Authority (1) category, as the speaker shifts responsibility to the credibility of unnamed experts rather than providing evidence for their claims.",
