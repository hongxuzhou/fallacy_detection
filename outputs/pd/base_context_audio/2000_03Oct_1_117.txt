Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze a statement from a presidential debate using pragma-dialectical argumentation. The task is to identify the primary fallacy, classify it, and provide a CoT analysis. 

First, I need to read the statement carefully. The statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." The context mentions Social Security revenues and expenses until 2015, and the speaker is addressing voters, saying retirees will get their promises. Then they mention allowing younger workers to take their money, implying a difference in opinion.

Looking at the PD rules, I need to check which ones are violated. The statement seems to be a general assertion. The speaker is talking about keeping promises, but in the context, they're discussing Social Security. The key here might be the relevance. The statement "A promise made will be a promise kept" is a general principle, but when applied to Social Security, the speaker is making a specific claim about the program's sustainability. 

Wait, the speaker says "all retirees are going to get the promises made," which might be a specific claim. However, the statement itself is a general principle. The problem here could be that the speaker is using a general principle to support a specific claim without proper evidence. But maybe it's more about relevance. The statement might be an appeal to emotion, using emotional language to persuade voters. The context mentions an emotional tone with high arousal and dominance. 

Alternatively, looking at the burden of proof rule: the speaker is asserting a promise will be kept without providing evidence. But the statement itself is a general principle. Wait, the statement is a maxim, not a claim that needs proof. However, when applied to Social Security, the speaker is making a specific claim. Maybe the fallacy here is a false cause? Or perhaps it's an appeal to emotion. 

Wait, the statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." This is a general statement, but in the context, it's used to support the idea that retirees will get their money. However, the speaker is also addressing voters who might be scared into voting, which suggests an appeal to emotion. The emotional tone in the context might be linked to the statement. 

Alternatively, the statement could be a straw man if the speaker is distorting the opponent's position. But the statement itself isn't attacking the opponent's argument. 

Looking at the relevance rule: the statement might be irrelevant if it's not properly connected to the Social Security discussion. But the speaker is using it to argue that promises will be kept, which is relevant. 

Wait, the speaker says "For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear." This suggests the speaker is addressing voters who might be scared, which is an appeal to emotion. The statement "A promise made will be a promise kept" is used to reassure them, which might be an appeal to emotion (category 0). 

But the primary fallacy here might be the appeal to emotion. The speaker is using emotional language to influence the audience, possibly by making them feel reassured about promises, which is an emotional appeal. The high valence and dominance in the tone support this. 

Alternatively, is there a false cause? If the speaker is implying that keeping promises is the reason for the policy, but that's not clear. 

The main issue seems to be the emotional appeal. The statement is a general principle used to reassure voters, which is an emotional appeal. So the primary fallacy would be Appeal to Emotion (0). 

Checking the PD rules again: the relevance rule says arguments must be relevant. The statement might be relevant, but the way it's presented could be an appeal to emotion. Also, the speaker is trying to influence the audience's emotions to sway their vote, which fits under appeal to emotion. 

So the classification would be 0 (Appeal to Emotion). The primary PD rule violation is the relevance rule, but the fallacy is Appeal to Emotion. Alternatively, maybe the burden of proof? If the speaker is making a claim without evidence, but the statement is a general principle. 

Wait, the statement itself is a maxim, not a claim that needs proof. The fallacy here is more about the emotional appeal. Therefore, the primary classification is Appeal to Emotion (0).
