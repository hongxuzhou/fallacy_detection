    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('our children will not see the American dream') to evoke fear and concern about the future, which distracts from addressing the actual argument about debt. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by prioritizing emotional appeal over logical reasoning. The emotional tone (high arousal, dominance) aligns with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category, as it manipulates the audience's emotional instincts rather than presenting relevant, evidence-based argumentation.",
