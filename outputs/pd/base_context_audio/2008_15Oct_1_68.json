    "analysis": "The statement attributes the housing crisis solely to Fannie and Freddie Mae's subprime lending, oversimplifying complex causal relationships. This violates the Argument Scheme Rule (Rule 8) by misinterpreting correlation as causation (False Cause (3)). The speaker assumes Fannie and Freddie were the sole cause without addressing other contributing factors, thereby misrepresenting the causal chain. This aligns with False Cause (3) as the primary fallacy, as it conflates a correlation (Fannie/Freddie's involvement) with a direct causal link to the crisis.",
