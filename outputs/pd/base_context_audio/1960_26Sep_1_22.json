    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language to imply that the President's vetoes are justified due to public support, without providing logical evidence. This violates the Relevance Rule (Rule 4) by substituting emotional appeal for relevant argumentation. The phrase 'the country is behind the President' evokes a sense of national unity, bypassing factual justification. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the speaker exploits emotional instincts rather than engaging in logical discourse.",
