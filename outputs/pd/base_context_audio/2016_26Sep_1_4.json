    "analysis": "The statement attacks Donald Trump's personal fortune and background rather than addressing his policy positions. This violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by discrediting the opponent through personal attacks (Ad Hominem). The speaker avoids engaging with Trump's actual arguments, instead undermining his credibility by highlighting his wealth and perceived biases. This aligns with the Ad Hominem (2) fallacy, as it focuses on attacking the person rather than the argument. The emotional tone and personal attacks further reinforce the violation of critical discussion norms.",
