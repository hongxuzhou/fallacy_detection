    "analysis": "The statement cites 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates as authority figures to support the claim that a policy is bad for the economy. While this may seem like an appeal to authority, the primary violation lies in the **Burden of Proof Rule** (Rule 2) and **Relevance Rule** (Rule 4). The speaker shifts the burden of proof by asserting the claim is self-evident through the authority of unnamed experts, without providing their specific arguments. This violates the Relevance Rule by relying on emotional appeal to authority rather than substantive reasoning. The **primary fallacy** is **Appeal to Authority (1)**, as the argument hinges on the prestige of experts without addressing the actual merits of the claim.",
