    "analysis": "The statement attacks the opponent's character ('all talk and no action') rather than addressing their actual arguments or policies, which violates the Freedom Rule by discrediting the opponent's position through personal criticism. This aligns with Ad Hominem (2), as it undermines the opponent's credibility rather than engaging with their standpoint. The emotional tone may amplify the attack but does not override the primary fallacy of personal attack.",
