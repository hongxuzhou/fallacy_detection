    "analysis": "The statement 'I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead' relies on the approval of the American people as a premise for its claim. This violates the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2) by presenting a claim (leadership competence) as self-evident without providing evidence or reasoning. The speaker assumes the American people's approval is sufficient proof, which aligns with Appeal to Authority (1), as the speaker cites the people's opinion as an authority figure. While the tone suggests emotional appeal, the core issue is the unexamined assumption of the people's authority, making Appeal to Authority the primary classification.",
