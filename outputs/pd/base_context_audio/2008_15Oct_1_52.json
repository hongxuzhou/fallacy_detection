    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('worst economic crisis since the Great Depression') to evoke fear and urgency, which aligns with the Appeal to Emotion (0) category. While the speaker attributes the crisis to policy failures, the primary issue is the use of loaded terms to manipulate emotional responses rather than presenting logical evidence. This violates the Language Use Rule (Rule 10) by employing vague or ambiguous phrasing to sway the audience, which is classified under Appeal to Emotion. The emotional tone described in the context further supports this classification.",
