    "analysis": "The statement compares price increases under two administrations without providing evidence, violating the Burden of Proof Rule (Rule 2). The speaker's emotional tone (high arousal, dominance) suggests an attempt to sway the audience through emotional appeal rather than factual argumentation. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the primary fallacy, as the emotional language is used to make the claim more persuasive without substantiation.",
