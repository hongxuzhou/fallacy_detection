    "analysis": "The statement attacks Hillary Clinton's judgment, which is a personal characteristic rather than addressing her policy arguments. This violates the Standpoint Rule (Rule 3) by distorting or attacking the person instead of their standpoint. It also violates the Freedom Rule (Rule 1) by discrediting her. However, the primary classification is Ad Hominem (2) because the attack targets her character (judgment) rather than her argument, fitting the 'general ad hominem' sub-type. The emotional tone (high dominance, assertiveness) reinforces the attack's intent to undermine her credibility.",
