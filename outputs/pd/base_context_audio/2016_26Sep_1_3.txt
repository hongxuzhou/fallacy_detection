Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. The user provided a statement from a political debate, and I need to apply pragma-dialectical argumentation analysis to identify the primary fallacy. 

First, I'll start with the CONTEXT CHECK. The statement is from a 2016 presidential debate, specifically on September 26. The speaker is likely a candidate, given the context of debates. The context mentions the speaker talking about $5 trillion and being blamed for everything, which sets a tense and emotional tone. The speaker's tone is high arousal and dominance, which might indicate they're trying to assert control or provoke a reaction.

Now, moving to STEP 1: DETECTION. The statement is: "And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton." 

I need to check which PD rules are violated here. The key part is the attack on Secretary Clinton, implying that the lack of leadership starts with her. This seems like an ad hominem attack. The speaker is not addressing the actual policy or argument about leadership but is instead attacking Clinton's character or position. 

Looking at the PD rules, the FREEDOM RULE (Rule 1) states that parties must not prevent each other from advancing or questioning standpoints. Violations include ad hominem, which is attacking the person instead of the argument. The speaker is attacking Clinton's leadership ability, which is a personal attack rather than addressing the actual issue. 

Rule 3, the STANDPOINT RULE, requires attacks to address the actual standpoint. The speaker is not engaging with the opposing argument about leadership but instead is undermining Clinton's credibility. This could be a straw man or a direct ad hominem. 

Rule 4, the RELEVANCE RULE, mentions irrelevant arguments. However, the main issue here is the personal attack, which falls under Rule 1. 

So, the primary violation seems to be the FREEDOM RULE, specifically an ad hominem attack. 

STEP 2: CLASSIFICATION. The primary PD rule violation is the FREEDOM RULE, which is a violation of the ad hominem (2) fallacy. The speaker is attacking Clinton's character rather than addressing the argument about leadership. 

STEP 3: JUSTIFICATION. The statement attacks Secretary Clinton's leadership ability, which is a personal attack (ad hominem) rather than addressing the actual argument. This violates the FREEDOM RULE by trying to discredit her instead of engaging with her standpoint. The ad hominem fallacy is a clear example here, as it shifts the focus from the argument to the person's character. 

I need to make sure there's no other PD rule violation. The speaker's emotional tone might suggest an appeal to emotion, but the main issue is the ad hominem. The other rules like burden of proof or relevance don't seem to apply here. The primary fallacy is definitely ad hominem (2).
