Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to analyze the given statement using pragma-dialectical argumentation rules. The statement is from a political debate, so I need to be careful about the context and the possible fallacies involved.

First, I'll start with the CONTEXT CHECK. The DATE is 1996-10-06, and the speaker is likely a politician, probably from the Republican party given the mention of Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole. The context mentions that the speaker is responding to someone else's statement, which is labeled as "That's not true," indicating a rebuttal. The speaker's tone is emotional with high arousal and dominance, which might influence the analysis.

Now, looking at the STATEMENT itself. The speaker is accusing Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich of specific actions related to tobacco and environmental laws. The key part here is the comparison between the speaker's actions and those of Dole and Gingrich. The speaker claims that it wasn't them who opposed certain measures, implying that Dole and Gingrich did. 

Step 1: DETECTION. I need to check which PD rules are violated. The statement seems to be attacking the opponents' positions by attributing specific actions to them. The speaker is not directly addressing the actual arguments but instead focusing on the opponents' past actions. This might relate to the STANDPOINT RULE, which requires attacks to address the actual standpoint. However, the speaker is not directly refuting the opponent's arguments but instead shifting blame. Alternatively, looking at the FREEDOM RULE, the speaker might be trying to discredit the opponents by attacking their past actions, which could be an Ad Hominem. 

Wait, the statement says "it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children..." This seems like the speaker is deflecting responsibility by implying that the opponents are the ones who opposed the measures. But the main issue here is whether the speaker is attacking the opponents' character or their past actions. If the speaker is saying that the opponents did something wrong (like letting polluters influence laws), then it might be an Ad Hominem (2), which is attacking the person's character or actions rather than the argument. 

Alternatively, the speaker is making a comparison between their own actions and those of Dole and Gingrich. The mention of "bragged about standing up for the Federal government" might be a straw man, but I'm not sure. Also, the speaker is not directly addressing the actual standpoint but instead pointing out past actions. This could be a violation of the STANDPOINT RULE if the argument is not addressing the actual position. However, the main issue seems to be the attack on the opponents' past actions, which could be an Ad Hominem. 

Looking at the output categories, Ad Hominem (2) includes attacks on the opponent's character or actions. The speaker is not directly attacking the opponent's current position but their past actions. However, the statement is more about attributing blame to the opponents rather than attacking their character. Wait, the statement is saying that the opponents did certain things (like letting polluters into Congress), which could be a form of ad hominem by implying that they are corrupt or have ulterior motives. 

Alternatively, the speaker might be using a Slippery Slope (4) if they're suggesting that opposing certain actions leads to extreme outcomes, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The main issue is the attack on the opponents' past actions to discredit their current stance. 

So, according to the PD rules, the FREEDOM RULE violation would be if the speaker is trying to silence or discredit the opponent. But the statement is more about shifting responsibility. The STANDPOINT RULE violation would be if the speaker is not addressing the actual standpoint. However, the speaker is not directly refuting the opponent's arguments but instead attributing blame. 

Wait, the statement is a rebuttal. The original statement was "That's not true," so the speaker is countering that. The speaker is not directly addressing the argument but instead shifting the focus to the opponents' past actions. This could be a Straw Man (which is under STANDPOINT RULE) if they are distorting the opponent's position. But the speaker is not distorting the position; they are attributing specific actions to the opponents. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using an Ad Hominem by attacking the opponents' past actions (like letting polluters influence laws) to discredit their current stance. This would fall under Ad Hominem (2), which includes attacks on the opponent's actions. 

So, the primary PD rule violation here is the Ad Hominem (2), which is attacking the opponent's actions rather than addressing the actual argument. The classification would be Ad Hominem (2). 

In the output categories, Ad Hominem (2) includes attacks on the opponent's actions, so this fits. The speaker is not directly defending their own position but instead undermining the opponents by attributing negative actions to them, which is a classic Ad Hominem. 

Therefore, the answer should be classification 2.
