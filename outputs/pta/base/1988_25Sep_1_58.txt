Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into its components: conclusion, premises, form, substance, and lever.

The statement is: "It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected."

So, the conclusion here seems to be that it's unfair to the average taxpayer. The premise is that the taxpayer pays taxes on time. The main point is about fairness, so the substance is likely a value (V) statement because it's about fairness.

Looking at the form, the structure is "a is X because a is Y." The subject here is the average taxpayer, and the predicate is about fairness. So this would be an alpha form. 

Now, the lever is the connection between the premise and conclusion. The argument is that because the taxpayer pays on time, it's unfair to let the money go uncollected. Wait, maybe the lever here is about fairness. But the substance is value, so according to the valid constraints for alpha (VF), it needs a criterion or definition lever. However, the argument is using the idea of fairness as the lever. But is that a valid lever? 

Wait, the lever here is the connection between the premise (taxpayer pays on time) and the conclusion (unfair to let money go uncollected). The argument is implying that because the taxpayer is responsible (pays on time), it's unfair to not collect the money. But maybe the lever is not properly connecting the two. 

Alternatively, maybe the fallacy here is an appeal to emotion. The statement uses emotionally charged language like "very unfair" and "average taxpayer" which might be trying to evoke sympathy. That could be an appeal to emotion (0). 

But let me check the constraints again. For an alpha form with value substance (VF), the lever should be a criterion or definition. The argument here is using the premise of the taxpayer's behavior to argue about fairness. But the connection isn't a clear criterion. Instead, it's more about emotional appeal. So maybe the lever is not properly defined, leading to an appeal to emotion. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an ad hominem? No, because it's not attacking the person but the situation. 

Wait, the statement is saying that it's unfair to the taxpayer because they pay on time. The conclusion is about fairness. The lever here might be that the taxpayer's responsible behavior makes it unfair to not collect the money. But that's a bit of a stretch. The actual lever might be the emotional appeal to fairness, which is a value judgment. 

But according to the constraints, for a value conclusion, the lever should be evaluative or principled. However, the argument is not providing a principled reason but rather using emotional language. So maybe it's an appeal to emotion. 

Alternatively, the lever is the idea that if someone is responsible (pays on time), then it's unfair not to collect the money. But that's a bit of a non sequitur. The connection between the premise and conclusion isn't clear. Wait, maybe the form is alpha (same subject), but the lever is not a criterion or definition. So the lever is missing, leading to a fallacy. 

Wait, the statement's structure is: "It's unfair to X (taxpayer) because X pays taxes on time." So the form is alpha (same subject). The substance is value (V) for the conclusion. The premise is also a value statement? Wait, the premise is that the taxpayer pays on time, which is a fact (F). Wait, the conclusion is a value (unfair), and the premise is a fact (taxpayer pays on time). So the form is alpha (same subject), with a fact premise and a value conclusion. 

In the valid constraints for alpha, when the form is alpha and the substances are VF (fact and value), the lever should be a criterion or definition. So the argument is using the fact that the taxpayer is responsible (pays on time) to argue that it's unfair (value). The lever here is the criterion that being responsible makes it unfair. But is that a valid lever? 

Alternatively, the argument is not properly connecting the premise to the conclusion. The lever is not a valid criterion. Instead, it's using emotional language to evoke sympathy, which is an appeal to emotion. 

So the primary violation is the appeal to emotion (0), because the argument is using emotionally charged terms like "unfair" and "average taxpayer" to influence the audience's feelings rather than providing a logical connection. The lever is not a valid criterion or definition, leading to the fallacy.
