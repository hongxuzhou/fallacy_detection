Okay, let's tackle this statement: "That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor." 

First, I need to break it down. The conclusion here is that there's more growth in the current administration compared to the predecessor. The premise is probably the data or evidence mentioned in the statement, but the statement itself doesn't include specific data. Wait, the statement is a bit vague. It says "that shows," implying that some prior evidence (maybe growth numbers) is being referenced.

So, the form here. The conclusion is about growth in the current administration (let's call this "A") versus the predecessor ("B"). The structure seems like comparing two different entities (A and B) based on a predicate (growth). So that's a BETA form because it's "A is X because B is X" but actually, it's comparing A and B's growth. Wait, the conclusion is that A has more growth than B. So the structure is "A has more growth than B because [some premise]." But the form here is about comparing two different subjects with the same predicate. So that's BETA form, which requires similarity or analogy levers. 

Now, the substance. The conclusion is about growth, which is a factual statement (F), and the premise (the "that shows") is also a fact. So both are F. 

The lever here is the comparison between the two administrations. But the problem is that the statement doesn't provide any specific evidence or data to support that the growth is actually more. It's just a comparison. So the lever is the assumption that the growth is more without proper evidence. 

Wait, the BETA form requires similarity/analogy/equality levers. But in this case, the lever is the comparison of growth between two different administrations. However, if there's no actual data or evidence provided to show that the growth is indeed more, then the lever is missing. So the argument is making a comparison without establishing the necessary link. 

Alternatively, maybe the lever is the assumption that the growth is more because of some other factor. But the statement doesn't specify. The primary issue here is that the argument is comparing two entities without proper evidence, which could be a false cause or a slippery slope. Wait, no. Let me check the fallacies again. 

The fallacy here might be Appeal to Authority (1) if they're citing an authority without evidence. But the statement doesn't mention an authority. Alternatively, it's an Appeal to Emotion (0) if it's using emotional language, but the statement is factual. 

Wait, the main issue is that the argument is comparing two different administrations' growth without providing any evidence or data. The lever is supposed to be the comparison, but if the comparison is not supported by facts, then it's a false cause (3)? Or maybe it's a false cause because it's assuming that the growth is more without establishing causation. 

Alternatively, the fallacy could be a false cause because the argument is assuming that the growth is more in the current administration without showing a direct cause. Wait, but the structure is BETA (comparing two subjects with the same predicate). The lever should be similarity or analogy. However, the statement is making a comparison without proper evidence, which could be a fallacy of false cause (assuming causation where there's none) or maybe a false comparison. 

Wait, the BETA form requires that the comparison between a and b is legitimate. If the argument doesn't establish that the comparison is valid (like, maybe the growth metrics are different, or the time periods are not comparable), then it's a fallacy. But the problem here is that the statement is making a claim without evidence. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause (3) because it's implying that the growth is due to the administration's policies without evidence. But the structure is more about comparing two different administrations. 

Alternatively, the lever is missing. Since the form is BETA (a is X because b is X), but the premise isn't actually provided. The statement is just asserting that "that shows," but the "that" is not given. So the argument is incomplete. However, the user is supposed to analyze the given statement. 

Wait, the statement is "That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor." So the premise is "that" (some prior data), and the conclusion is the comparison. But the problem is that the argument is using the premise (which is the data) to support the conclusion. But if the premise is not actually provided, then the argument is weak. However, the user's task is to analyze the given statement, which includes the premise. 

Assuming that the premise is the data that "that" refers to, but the statement doesn't include that data. Therefore, the argument is making a comparison without evidence, which could be a false cause (assuming that the growth is more because of the administration's actions, but without evidence). 

Alternatively, it's a false cause because the argument is assuming that the growth is due to the administration's policies, but that's not stated. 

Wait, the form is BETA (a is X because b is X), but in this case, the conclusion is that a has more growth than b. So the structure is a is X (more growth) because b is X (growth in predecessor). Wait, that's not matching. The BETA form is when a is X because b is X. But here, the conclusion is a has more X than b. So maybe the form is Gamma (a is X because b is Y), but the conclusion is a is X (more growth) than b. 

Alternatively, the form is Gamma, where the lever is the comparison between a and b. But Gamma requires parallel relationships, like a:b as X:Y. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try again. 

The conclusion is "more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor." The premise is that "that shows" (some evidence). The form is comparing two different subjects (current and predecessor administrations) with the same predicate (growth). So it's a BETA form (a is X because b is X). But the conclusion is about a having more X than b, not that a is X because b is X. 

Wait, maybe the form is not BETA. BETA is when a is X because b is X. But here, the conclusion is that a has more X than b. So the structure is different. 

Alternatively, the form is Gamma (a is X because b is Y). For example, if the premise is that the predecessor had less growth, then the conclusion is the current has more. But the lever would be the comparison. 

But the problem is that the argument is not providing the necessary evidence. The lever is supposed to connect the non-common elements. In this case, the non-common elements are the two administrations. The lever is the comparison of their growth. However, without evidence, the lever is invalid. 

The fallacy here might be a false cause (3) if the argument is assuming that the growth is more because of the administration's actions without evidence. But the structure is more about comparing two entities. 

Alternatively, it's an Appeal to Authority (1) if the argument is citing an authority's data. But the statement doesn't mention an authority. 

Alternatively, it's an Appeal to Emotion (0) if the statement uses emotional language, but it's more factual. 

Wait, the primary issue is that the argument is making a comparison without establishing the necessary lever. The lever for BETA should be similarity or analogy. But the argument is just stating that there's more growth without showing that the comparison is valid. So this could be a false cause (3) because it's assuming a causal relationship between the administrations and the growth without evidence. 

But maybe the correct fallacy is False Cause (3). Alternatively, it's a Slippery Slope (4) if it's implying that the growth leads to some negative outcome, but that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, the lever is missing. Since the form is BETA, which requires similarity or analogy, but the argument doesn't provide that. So the lever is missing, leading to a fallacy. However, the PTA framework lists specific fallacies. 

Looking back at the fallacy list, the primary fallacy here might be False Cause (3) because the argument is assuming that the growth is more in the current administration without establishing a causal link. But I'm not entirely sure. 

Alternatively, it's an Appeal to Popularity (1) if it's implying that the majority believes it, but the statement doesn't mention that. 

Wait, the statement is just making a comparison. The main issue is that the argument is not providing the necessary evidence to support the comparison. So the lever is missing, which would be a violation of the BETA form's requirement for similarity/analogy. Therefore, the fallacy would be Appeal to Authority (1) if the argument is citing an authority, but since it's not, maybe it's a false cause. 

Alternatively, the lever is the comparison, but without evidence, it's a false cause. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct classification is False Cause (3) because the argument is assuming that the growth is more due to the administration's actions without evidence. But I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, the fallacy is Appeal to Emotion (0) if the statement is using emotional language, but the statement is factual. 

I think the primary issue is that the argument is making a comparison without providing evidence, which could be a false cause. Therefore, the classification is 3 (False Cause).
