    "analysis": "The statement uses Abraham Lincoln's authority as a lever to support the claim about serving the nation. This is a Beta form (a is X because b is X) where the lever should establish similarity or analogy. However, the lever here is an appeal to authority (Lincoln's status) rather than a legitimate comparison, violating the Beta form's requirement for similarity/analogy. This constitutes an Appeal to Authority (1).",
