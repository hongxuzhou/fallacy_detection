    "analysis": "The statement presents a factual claim about the number of killings in Chicago during Barack Obama's presidency. However, it implicitly assumes a causal relationship between Obama's presidency and the high crime rate without establishing a direct causal link. This violates the constraint for Alpha form (same subject) where FF (Fact to Fact) requires a causal/effect lever. The argument falsely infers causation from mere correlation, fitting the False Cause (3) fallacy.",
