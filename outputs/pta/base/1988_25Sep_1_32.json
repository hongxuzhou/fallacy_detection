    "analysis": "The statement cites Paul Tsongas's opinion as a reason to label opposing the capital gains cut as 'dumbest.' This violates the BETA form constraint by using an authority's statement (Tsongas) as a lever to justify a value judgment (dumbest action) without establishing a legitimate comparison or relevance. The lever here is an appeal to authority (1) since it relies on Tsongas's status as a senator rather than substantive evidence.",
