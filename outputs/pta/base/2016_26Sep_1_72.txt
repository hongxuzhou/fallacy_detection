Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into conclusion and premises. The statement seems to be arguing against the Obama administration's debt policies. The conclusion might be that you can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The premises are about the debt increasing under Obama, doubling in seven and a half years, and comparing it to 230 years' worth of debt.

Next, I need to determine the form. The conclusion is about the current situation (you can't do X with debt), and the premises talk about the debt levels under Obama. The subjects here are the Obama administration's debt and the current debt. So the form seems to be BETA (a is X because b is X), where a is the current situation and b is Obama's debt. But wait, the conclusion is about the current debt, and the premise is about Obama's debt. Maybe it's a comparison between the two. But the form is BETA, which requires a comparison between a and b. However, the lever here is the comparison of debt amounts. 

Now, substance: the conclusion is a policy statement (P) because it's about whether something can be done given the debt. The premises are factual (F) about the debt figures. The lever is the comparison between the debt levels. But BETA requires similarity or analogy levers. The problem is that the argument is comparing the debt under Obama to the current debt, but the lever might be the amount. However, the statement is not making an analogy or similarity but rather stating that the debt has doubled, which is a factual claim. Wait, maybe the form is GAMMA, where a is X because b is Y. But the conclusion is about the current situation, and the premise is about the past. 

Wait, the form could be ALPHA if the same subject is being discussed. But the conclusion is about the current debt, and the premise is about Obama's debt. So maybe the form is BETA, comparing two different instances of debt. The lever here is the comparison of debt amounts. However, the argument is not establishing a legitimate comparison between the two. The statement is using the debt figures to argue that the current situation is unsustainable, but the lever might be the comparison in magnitude. But the problem is that the argument is not providing a valid analogy or similarity. 

Alternatively, the lever might be a causal one. The argument is saying that because the debt has doubled, you can't do what you're looking to do. That might be a false cause (3), assuming that the debt increase leads to the inability to act. But the form here might be ALPHA, where the conclusion is a policy (P) and the premise is a fact (F). The lever would need to be a causal or effect lever. But the argument is not clearly stating a cause-effect relationship. Instead, it's using the debt figures to argue against the feasibility, which might be a false cause. 

Wait, the classification options include Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), Ad Hominem (2), False Cause (3), Slippery Slope (4), and Slogans (5). The statement is using the debt figures to argue against the current policy, but the lever is the comparison of debt levels. However, the argument might be a false cause if it's implying that the debt increase is the reason for the inability to act. But the form might be BETA, comparing the debt under Obama to the current debt. The lever is the similarity in debt amounts. But the problem is that the comparison isn't valid. The argument is using the debt figures to suggest that the current situation is worse, but the lever is not properly established. 

Alternatively, the argument could be a false cause (3) because it's implying that the debt increase (cause) leads to the inability to act (effect). However, the form is not clearly ALPHA. The conclusion is a policy (P) and the premise is a fact (F), so if the lever is causal, that would fit ALPHA. But the lever here is the debt increase leading to the inability, which might be a false cause. However, the statement doesn't explicitly state a causal link. It just states the debt has doubled, so the conclusion is that you can't do X. That's more of a false cause, assuming that the debt level is the reason for the inability. 

Alternatively, the argument might be using the debt figures to make an emotional appeal (Appeal to Emotion 0), but the statement doesn't use emotional language. It's more about the numbers. So maybe it's False Cause (3). The primary violation is that the argument assumes a causal relationship between the debt increase and the inability to act without proper justification. So the classification would be 3.
