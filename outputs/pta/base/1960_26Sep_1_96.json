    "analysis": "The argument assumes a direct causal link between federal government authority to pay teachers (A) and subsequent authority to set standards/dictate curriculum (B), without establishing a valid causal mechanism. This is a classic False Cause (3) fallacy, as it incorrectly infers causation from correlation. The lever (causal relationship) lacks justification for the leap from financial authority to instructional control.",
