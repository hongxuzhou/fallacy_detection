    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('Thank you', 'standing with you strong', 'vital mission') to evoke loyalty and support without presenting logical or factual reasoning. This violates the constraint that arguments with value (V) substance must use evaluative/principled levers, not emotional appeals. The primary violation is an appeal to emotion through loaded language.",
