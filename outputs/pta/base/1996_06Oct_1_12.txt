Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework to detect fallacies. Let me start by breaking down the statement.

The statement is: "I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill."

First, I need to identify the conclusion and premises. The conclusion seems to be that Senator Dole didn't support the McCain-Feingold bill, perhaps implying he's not responsible for its failure. The premises are that the members of his own party killed it and he didn't urge them to vote for it.

Next, determine the form. The first part is about the speaker supporting something, then the second part connects Senator Dole's party members killing the bill, and the third part says he didn't urge them. The form here might be Beta (a is X because b is X) if comparing Dole's actions to his party members. But maybe it's more about the lever between the party members' actions and Dole's responsibility.

Substance: The statements are about actions and political positions, so they might be Value (V) or Policy (P). The lever here is the connection between Dole's inaction and the party members' actions. The argument is implying that since his own party members killed the bill and he didn't push for it, he's not responsible. 

Looking at the constraints, Beta requires similarity or analogy. The lever here is the comparison between Dole's inaction and the party members' actions. But the argument might be shifting blame onto the party members, suggesting that Dole isn't responsible because they did the killing. This could be an Ad Hominem, attacking the party members' actions to deflect from Dole's responsibility. Wait, but the user's fallacy list includes Ad Hominem as attacking the person. Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause, assuming that because the party members killed it, Dole is not responsible. Or maybe it's an Appeal to Authority if they're citing the party's actions as evidence. 

Wait, the main issue here is that the argument is trying to shift responsibility by pointing out that the party members killed the bill, implying that Dole isn't to blame. This could be a form of Ad Hominem, specifically the "tu quoque" type, where the argument says "you did it first" or that the opponent is not responsible because others acted. Alternatively, it might be a False Cause, assuming that the party members' actions are due to Dole's lack of urging. 

Wait, looking at the PTA structure, the form might be Gamma (a is X because b is Y), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's Beta if comparing Dole's actions to the party members. The lever here is the connection between Dole's inaction and the party members' actions. But the argument is trying to deflect responsibility, which might be an Ad Hominem (attacking the party members' actions to undermine Dole's responsibility). However, the user's Ad Hominem subtypes include general, tu quoque, and bias. The tu quoque is "you did it first," which might fit here. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause, assuming that because the party members killed it, Dole isn't responsible. But the main fallacy here seems to be attacking the party members' actions to shift blame, which is an Ad Hominem. Wait, but the statement is about the party members, not the opponent. The original argument is that Dole wasn't urging them, so he's not responsible. This could be a False Cause if they're assuming that the party members' actions are due to Dole's inaction, but the argument is more about shifting responsibility. 

Wait, maybe the primary fallacy is Appeal to Authority, but the argument is not citing an authority. Alternatively, it's an Ad Hominem, attacking the party members' actions. Wait, the statement is saying that Dole didn't urge them, so they killed the bill. The argument is implying that Dole isn't responsible because the party members acted. That's more of a False Cause, assuming that the party members' actions are a result of Dole's inaction, which might not be the case. But the primary fallacy here might be a False Cause (3) because it's assuming a causal link between Dole's inaction and the party members' actions. 

Alternatively, the argument is using the party members' actions to shift blame, which is an Ad Hominem (type 2) by attacking the party members' actions. Wait, the Ad Hominem is attacking the person, but here the argument is attacking the party members' actions, which might be a form of tu quoque. 

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the fallacy definitions again. The Ad Hominem includes tu quoque, which is "you did it first." The argument here is that the party members killed the bill, implying that Dole isn't responsible because they did it. So, it's shifting the blame to the party members, which could be a tu quoque attack. Alternatively, it's an appeal to the party's actions as a form of authority. 

Wait, the statement is not attacking the person (Dole) but the party members. The argument is that since the party members did it, Dole isn't responsible. This might be a False Cause, assuming that the party members' actions are due to Dole's inaction. Alternatively, it's a Straw Man if they're misrepresenting the party's actions. 

Alternatively, the argument is using the party members' actions to imply that Dole is not responsible, which could be a False Cause (3) by assuming that the party members' actions are a result of Dole's inaction. 

But the primary violation here might be that the argument is shifting responsibility by attacking the party members' actions, which is an Ad Hominem (tu quoque) by implying that since others did it, Dole isn't to blame. 

Alternatively, the main issue is that the argument is not providing a direct link between Dole's actions and the party's actions, which might be a False Cause. 

I think the main fallacy here is False Cause (3) because it's assuming that the party members' actions are a result of Dole's inaction without proper evidence. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the argument is using the party members' actions to deflect blame, which could be an Ad Hominem (tu quoque) by implying that the party members' actions are the cause, not Dole's. 

But according to the PTA framework, the form would be Beta (a is X because b is X), which requires similarity/analogy. The lever here is the comparison between Dole's inaction and the party members' actions. But the argument is not establishing a legitimate comparison, so that might be a Beta violation. 

Wait, the form is Beta if the premise is about the party members and the conclusion is about Dole. The lever is the connection between the party members' actions and Dole's responsibility. If the argument is saying that because the party members killed it, Dole isn't responsible, that's a false cause. 

Alternatively, the argument is using the party members' actions as evidence against Dole, which could be an Appeal to Authority if the party is considered an authority. But the statement doesn't mention authority. 

I think the primary fallacy here is False Cause (3), as the argument assumes a causal link between Dole's inaction and the party members' actions without evidence. Therefore, the classification would be 3.
