    "analysis": "The statement presents a factual claim (F) about the president's role in deficits without establishing a valid lever. The form appears to be alpha (same subject), but the lever (causal/effect) is not substantiated. The argument assumes causation without evidence, violating the constraint for alpha form (FF) which requires causal levers. This constitutes a false cause fallacy by correlating the president's actions with deficits without proper justification.",
