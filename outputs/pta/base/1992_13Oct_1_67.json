    "analysis": "The statement presents three premises (investing in national security, investing in military, and having political will) all leading to the same conclusion (winning the Cold War). Each premise follows the ALPHA form (same subject, different predicate), but the third premise involves a Value (V) premise (political will) leading to a Fact (F) conclusion. This violates the lever constraint for VF (Value-Fact) pairs, which require criterion/definition levers, not causal ones. The argument improperly attributes causation (False Cause) without valid justification.",
