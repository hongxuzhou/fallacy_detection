    "analysis": "The statement shifts from a factual premise (spending on war) to a value-based conclusion (bright future) without establishing a valid lever. The emotional language ('bright future', 'rebuild America') exploits emotional instincts rather than logical connections. This violates the constraint for Alpha form (F\u2192V) by lacking evaluative/principled levers, relying instead on emotive appeals.",
