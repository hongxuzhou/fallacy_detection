Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into its components: conclusion, premises, form, substance, and lever. 

The statement is: "I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go."

So, the conclusion here is that the speaker's economic ideas are the correct way to go. The premises are the endorsements from 9 Nobel laureates, over 500 economists, and hundreds of business people, including Republicans.

Now, looking at the form. The conclusion is about the speaker's ideas (subject a), and the premise is about the endorsements from various experts (subject b). So this seems like a BETA form, where a is X because b is X. The lever here is the authority of these experts. 

Substance-wise, the conclusion is a Policy (P) because it's about implementing economic ideas. The premises are Facts (F) since they state the existence of these experts. Wait, but the premises are about the experts' agreement, which might be a Value (V) if it's about their endorsement as a criterion. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. 

Wait, the substance of the premise is that these experts have endorsed the ideas. So the premise is a Fact (they exist and endorsed), and the conclusion is a Policy (should adopt these ideas). So the form is BETA (a is X because b is X), but the lever is the authority of the experts. 

According to the valid constraints for BETA, the lever should be similarity, analogy, or equality. But here, the lever is appeal to authority. The problem is that the argument is using the authority of the experts (Nobel winners, economists) to support the policy. However, the BETA form requires a legitimate comparison between a and b. But in this case, the premise is about the experts endorsing the ideas, not about the experts having the same attributes as the conclusion. 

Wait, the BETA form is when the subject a is X because another subject b is X. So if the conclusion is that the speaker's ideas are correct (a is X), and the premise is that experts (b) endorse them (b is X), then the lever is the similarity in their endorsement. But the problem here is that the argument is using the authority of the experts as a lever, which is actually an Appeal to Authority fallacy. 

Looking at the fallacy list, Appeal to Authority (1) is when the argument cites an authority without relevant evidence. The statement here cites many experts, but does it provide evidence that their endorsement is relevant? The argument is that because these experts agree, the ideas are correct. However, the validity of the argument depends on whether the experts are relevant and their endorsement is a valid criterion. But the structure here might be violating the BETA constraints because the lever is not a similarity or analogy but an appeal to authority. 

Wait, the BETA form requires a similarity or analogy between a and b. In this case, the conclusion is about the speaker's ideas (a) being correct, and the premise is that experts (b) endorse them. The lever here is the experts' endorsement, which is a form of authority. But according to the PTA framework, the BETA form requires a similarity or analogy. So if the lever is not a similarity but an appeal to authority, that's a violation. 

Alternatively, maybe the lever is the experts' agreement, which is a form of similarity. Wait, but the BETA lever requires that the comparison between a and b is legitimate. If the experts are endorsing the ideas, then the premise is that b (experts) are X (endorse), and the conclusion is that a (ideas) are X (correct). But the lever here is the experts' endorsement as a criterion. 

Wait, the substance of the premise is a Fact (they exist and endorsed), and the conclusion is a Policy (should adopt). So the form is BETA (a is X because b is X), but the lever is the authority of the experts. However, the valid constraints for BETA require similarity, analogy, or equality. The lever here is an appeal to authority, which is not a similarity but an appeal to authority. Therefore, this is a violation of the BETA form's constraints, leading to an Appeal to Authority fallacy (classification 1). 

Alternatively, if the form is ALPHA, but the conclusion and premise have the same subject? Wait, the conclusion is the speaker's ideas (a), and the premise is the experts (b). So it's BETA. 

So the primary violation is Appeal to Authority (1), as the argument relies on the authority of the experts without establishing a legitimate comparison or similarity between the experts and the ideas. The lever is the authority, which is not a valid lever for BETA form. Hence, classification 1.
