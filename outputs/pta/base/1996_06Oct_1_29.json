    "analysis": "The argument cites the authority of 500 economists and Nobel laureates to support the claim that a policy is bad for the economy. This violates the BETA form constraint, which requires a similarity/analogy/equality lever between the subject (policy) and the cited authority (economists). Instead, the lever is an appeal to authority, which is not a valid connection for BETA. The argument improperly relies on the credibility of experts without establishing a legitimate comparison or analogy.",
