    "analysis": "The statement compares the current number of hungry people in the U.S. to a past period under the Truman Administration, implying progress. The lever is a comparison (Beta form), but the emotional emphasis on 'far less' and the use of 'incidently' (to downplay past conditions) exploit emotional framing. This violates the constraint by using loaded language to evoke a positive emotional response rather than a neutral factual comparison.",
