Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework to detect fallacies. 

First, I need to break down the statement. The statement compares inflation rates under Nixon and Ford to those under Johnson and Kennedy, and also mentions economic growth being less than half today compared to the start of the year. 

So, the conclusion here seems to be that the current administration (Nixon and Ford) is worse in terms of inflation and economic growth. The premises are the data points about inflation rates and growth rates.

Now, looking at the form. The first part compares inflation rates between different administrations. The subjects here are the administrations (Nixon/Ford vs. Johnson/Kennedy), and the predicate is inflation rate. The second part compares economic growth today to the beginning of the year. So, the form here might be Beta (a is X because b is X), since it's comparing two different administrations (a and b) on the same predicate (inflation rate). But wait, the second part is comparing the same administration's growth over time, so maybe that's a different form. But the main argument is about the current administration's performance versus the past ones.

Next, substance. The inflation rate and economic growth are factual statements, so they are F (Fact). The conclusion is about the current administration's performance, which could be a value judgment, but the statement itself is presenting data, so maybe the conclusion is also a fact. Wait, the conclusion is that the current administration's inflation is higher and growth is lower. So the substance here is Fact (F) for both premise and conclusion.

Now, the lever. The connection here is that the current administration's inflation is higher and growth is lower. But the lever is the comparison between different administrations. For Beta form, the lever should be similarity or analogy. But the problem is that the statement is comparing different time periods, but the administrations are different. However, the lever here is the inflation rate and growth rate as metrics. Wait, the lever is the comparison of the same metrics across different administrations. But the issue is that the time periods are different. For example, the inflation rates under Nixon and Ford might be compared to those under Johnson and Kennedy, but the time frames might not be the same. So the lever here is the inflation rate as a metric, but the comparison might be flawed because the time periods are different. 

Wait, the first part says "under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy." So the premise is that the inflation rate under Nixon/Ford is three times that under Johnson/Kennedy. The conclusion is that the economic growth is less than half today compared to the start of the year. But the second part is about economic growth, which is a separate metric. However, the main argument seems to be that the current administration's policies are worse because of higher inflation and lower growth. 

But the problem here is that the comparison is between different administrations and different time periods. The lever for the Beta form (a is X because b is X) requires a legitimate comparison. However, the time periods might not be comparable. For example, if Johnson and Kennedy were in the 1960s and Nixon and Ford in the 1970s, the economic contexts are different. The inflation rate could be higher due to different factors, not necessarily the administration's policies. So the lever here is a comparison between different administrations, but the time periods and economic conditions may not be the same, leading to a false cause or a faulty comparison. 

Wait, the form here might be Gamma (a is X because b is Y), but that's when the relationship is parallel. Alternatively, if it's Beta, then the lever should be similarity. However, the comparison is between different administrations and different time frames, which might not be a valid comparison. This could be a False Cause (3) because the argument assumes that the higher inflation is due to the current administration, but there might be other factors. Alternatively, it's an Appeal to Authority if they're citing past administrations, but I don't think that's the case here. 

Wait, looking at the classification options. The fallacy here is probably False Cause (3) because the argument is implying that the current administration is responsible for the higher inflation and lower growth, but it's possible that other factors (like oil crises, changes in monetary policy, etc.) are the real causes. The argument is correlating the administration with the economic outcomes without establishing a causal link. So the lever is the comparison between administrations, but the causal link isn't properly established. Therefore, this would be a False Cause (3) fallacy. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a Slippery Slope (4), but that's about a chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. The statement doesn't mention a chain of events leading to a catastrophe, so that's less likely. 

Another possibility is Appeal to Emotion (0), but the statement is factual data, so that's not it. 

So the primary fallacy here is False Cause (3), as the argument incorrectly assumes causation from correlation between the administration and economic outcomes without considering other factors.
