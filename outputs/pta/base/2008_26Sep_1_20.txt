Okay, let's tackle this statement: "Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America." 

First, I need to break it down according to the PTA framework. Let's start by identifying the conclusion and premise. The conclusion here seems to be that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America. The premise is Admiral Mullen's suggestion. 

Next, determining the form. The structure here is comparing two different subjects: Admiral Mullen (a person) and Senator Obama's plan (a policy). So the form is Beta (a is X because b is X), where a is the plan and b is Admiral Mullen's suggestion. Wait, actually, the form is about the relationship between the subjects and predicates. Let me think again. The conclusion is about the plan being dangerous (X), and the premise is that Admiral Mullen suggests it. So the form is Beta because the conclusion about the plan (a) is based on the premise involving Admiral Mullen (b). 

Now, substance: the conclusion is a value judgment (V) since it's about the plan being dangerous. The premise is a statement about someone's suggestion, which might be a fact (F) if it's about the suggestion itself, but maybe it's a value as well. Wait, the premise is that Admiral Mullen suggests something. The substance of the premise might be a fact (if it's stating that he made a suggestion), but the conclusion is a value (dangerous). 

The lever here is the connection between Admiral Mullen's suggestion and the plan being dangerous. The lever would be the authority of Admiral Mullen. So, the argument is using Admiral Mullen's authority to support the claim. 

Now checking the constraints for Beta form. Beta requires similarity, analogy, or equality levers. But here, the lever is an appeal to authority. The problem is that the argument is using Admiral Mullen's position (as an authority) to support the conclusion. However, the Beta form requires that there's a legitimate comparison between the two elements. But in this case, the premise is that Admiral Mullen suggests something, and the conclusion is that the plan is dangerous. The lever here is the authority of Admiral Mullen. 

Wait, according to the Delta form, which is when the lever is about acceptability indicators like expert sources. But the form here is Beta. Wait, maybe I'm mixing forms. Let me check again. 

The form is Beta (a is X because b is X). The conclusion is about the plan (a) being dangerous (X), and the premise is that Admiral Mullen (b) suggests that. So, the lever is the authority of Admiral Mullen. But Beta requires similarity, analogy, or equality. However, the argument is not comparing the plan to something else but using an authority's opinion. 

Wait, maybe this is an Appeal to Authority (1). Because the argument is using the authority of Admiral Mullen without providing evidence. The lever here is the authority, but the form is Beta. However, the Beta form requires a comparison. But in this case, the argument is not establishing a similarity or analogy between the plan and Admiral Mullen's suggestion. Instead, it's using the authority's opinion as a premise. 

Wait, perhaps the form is actually Delta? Because Delta is when the acceptability is based on a source. The structure of Delta is q is acceptable because q is Z, where Z is an acceptability indicator. But in this case, the conclusion is about the plan being dangerous, not about its acceptability. So maybe the form is not Delta. 

Alternatively, the argument is using the authority (Admiral Mullen) as a lever, which would be an Appeal to Authority. But according to the PTA constraints, Beta form requires a similarity or analogy. However, the lever here is not a similarity but an authority. So the lever is not matching the required type for Beta. Therefore, this is a violation of the Beta form's constraints. 

Wait, the Beta form requires that the conclusion (a is X) is based on the premise (b is X). So if the premise is that Admiral Mullen (b) suggests that the plan is dangerous (X), then the conclusion would be that the plan is dangerous (a is X). But the structure here is that the premise is that Admiral Mullen suggests something, and the conclusion is that the plan is dangerous. So the form is Beta, where a is the plan and b is Admiral Mullen. But the lever is the authority, which isn't a similarity or analogy. 

Therefore, the lever is not a similarity, analogy, or equality, which violates the Beta form's constraints. Hence, the fallacy would be Appeal to Authority (1), which is the classification here. 

Alternatively, maybe the form is Alpha, but that's when the same subject is involved. Since the subjects are different (Admiral Mullen vs. the plan), it's Beta. So the primary violation is using an authority without proper comparison, leading to Appeal to Authority.
