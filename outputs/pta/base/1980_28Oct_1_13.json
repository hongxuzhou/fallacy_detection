    "analysis": "The argument assumes that Mr. Carter's stated policy (increasing unemployment to fight inflation) directly equates to him using unemployment as a tool, which is a causal leap. The form is GAMMA (a is X because b is Y), but the lever (parallel relationship) is invalid as the premise (policy) and conclusion (action) are not logically connected. This violates the constraint for GAMMA, leading to a False Cause (3) fallacy by misinterpreting correlation as causation.",
