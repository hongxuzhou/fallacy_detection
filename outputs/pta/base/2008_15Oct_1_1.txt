Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the given statement using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework to detect fallacies. First, I need to break down the statement into its components: conclusion, premises, form, substance, and lever.

The statement is about Senator Obama's voting record on certain abortion-related bills. The speaker is criticizing Obama's votes, pointing out he voted against a law providing medical attention to children born from failed abortions and against a ban on partial-birth abortion, but voted "present" on the floor. The conclusion seems to be that Obama is inconsistent or hypocritical in his stance on abortion. 

Now, looking at the form. The structure here is comparing Obama's actions in different contexts. The premises are his votes in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor. The conclusion is about his inconsistency. So the form might be Beta (a is X because b is X), where a is Obama's voting on one bill and b is his voting on another. But the lever here is the comparison between these two votes to suggest hypocrisy. 

Substance-wise, the premises are factual (F) statements about his votes. The conclusion is a value judgment (V) about his consistency. The lever is the comparison of his votes to imply inconsistency. 

But wait, the Beta form requires similarity or analogy. The argument is using the fact that he voted against certain bills in committee but present on the floor to imply he's inconsistent. However, the lever here is not establishing a legitimate comparison. The speaker is not showing that the two votes are similar in a way that would make the inconsistency significant. Instead, they're using the different votes to attack his consistency, which might be a fallacy. 

Looking at the fallacies listed, Appeal to Authority (1) isn't here. Ad Hominem (2) could be if they're attacking his character, but the statement is more about his actions. False Cause (3) is about correlation vs causation, which isn't the case here. Slippery Slope (4) isn't applicable. Slogans (5) are catchy phrases, not really here. 

Wait, the main issue here is the comparison. The argument is using the difference in votes (committee vs floor) to imply inconsistency. However, the lever is not a proper comparison. The form is Beta, which requires similarity or analogy. But the speaker is using the difference in votes to suggest hypocrisy, which might not be a valid comparison. Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause (3) if they're implying that his votes are connected in a causal way. But the statement doesn't make a causal claim, just points out different votes. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an Ad Hominem (2) if they're attacking his consistency as a character flaw. But the statement is more about his actions than attacking his character directly. 

Wait, the user's example in the fallacies mentions that Appeal to Emotion (0) includes loaded language. The statement uses phrases like "terrible" and "bad procedures," which could be loaded language. That might be an appeal to emotion (0). But the main structure is comparing his votes. 

Alternatively, the primary fallacy here is False Cause (3) if they're implying that his votes are connected in a way they aren't. Or maybe it's a Straw Man (but that's not in the list). Wait, the options are 0-5 as per the given list. 

Looking back at the constraints for Beta (form BETA: a is X because b is X). The lever must be similarity/analogy. Here, the argument is using two different votes (against in committee, present on floor) to imply inconsistency. But the lever isn't a legitimate comparison. Instead, it's using the difference to attack his consistency, which might be a fallacy. 

Wait, the form is Beta, but the lever is not a similarity. The argument is not saying that because b is X, a is X. Instead, it's pointing out that a and b are different, leading to a conclusion about inconsistency. So maybe the form is not Beta, but another form. 

Alternatively, the argument is using the fact that he voted against one bill and present on another to imply that he's inconsistent. This might be a False Cause (3) if they're suggesting that his actions are connected in a way they aren't. But the statement doesn't claim a direct cause-effect. 

Alternatively, the main fallacy is Appeal to Emotion (0) due to loaded language like "terrible" and "bad procedures." The use of emotionally charged terms could be intended to evoke a negative reaction, which would fall under appeal to emotion. 

But the user's instructions say to focus on the primary structural violation. The statement's structure might be a Beta form, but the lever is not a valid comparison. The speaker is comparing two different votes (against in committee, present on floor) to suggest inconsistency. However, the lever isn't establishing a similarity or analogy. Instead, it's pointing out a difference, which might not fit Beta. 

Alternatively, the form could be Gamma (a is X because b is Y) if there's a parallel relationship. But the argument isn't showing a proportional or opposite relationship. 

Wait, the main issue here is that the argument is using the different votes to imply that Obama is inconsistent, which is a value judgment. The lever is the comparison between the two votes, but the comparison isn't valid. The form is Beta, but the lever isn't a similarity. Therefore, this might be a False Cause (3) if the argument is implying that the different votes are connected in a way they aren't. However, the statement doesn't claim a direct cause-effect, so maybe it's not False Cause. 

Alternatively, since the argument is using the different votes to attack Obama's consistency, which is a value judgment (V), and the premises are facts (F), the lever is not properly connecting them. The form would be Beta, but the lever is not similarity. Therefore, this might be a fallacy of False Cause (3) or Appeal to Emotion (0). 

But the loaded language is present, so maybe Appeal to Emotion (0) is the primary fallacy. However, the main structural violation is the lever not matching the form. 

Alternatively, the primary violation is the lever not being a valid comparison, leading to a False Cause (3) or another fallacy. 

Hmm. The user's example might be more about the use of loaded language. The phrases "terrible procedures" and "bad procedures" are emotionally charged, which could be an appeal to emotion (0). So the classification would be 0. 

But I need to check the structure again. The conclusion is that Obama is inconsistent. The premises are his votes. The form is Beta (a is X because b is X), but the lever is not similarity. The argument is using the difference in votes to imply inconsistency, which isn't a valid comparison. Therefore, the lever is not a similarity, which violates Beta's requirement. So this would be a fallacy. 

But the options for fallacies include Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), etc. The main issue here is the use of emotionally charged language, which is 0. However, the structural violation is the lever not being a valid comparison. 

Wait, the user's instructions say to focus on the primary structural violation. The structure here is Beta, but the lever is not a similarity. Therefore, the fallacy would be a violation of the Beta constraint, which requires similarity/analogy. Since the argument is comparing two different votes but not showing a legitimate comparison, it's a fallacy. 

But the options don't have a direct category for that. Looking back at the fallacy list, the closest might be False Cause (3), but that's about correlation vs causation. Alternatively, it's an appeal to emotion (0) due to the loaded language. 

Alternatively, the primary fallacy is Appeal to Emotion (0) because of the emotionally charged terms. The statement uses words like "terrible" and "bad procedures" to evoke a negative reaction, which is an appeal to emotion. 

Therefore, the classification would be 0. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, the argument is using the different votes to imply inconsistency, which is a value judgment (V) based on factual premises (F). The lever is the comparison, which isn't a valid similarity, leading to a fallacy. However, the PTA framework's constraints for Beta require similarity. Therefore, the lever is invalid, leading to a fallacy. 

But the fallacy list doesn't have a specific code for that. The closest might be False Cause (3) if the argument is implying a causal link between his votes and his inconsistency. However, the argument isn't making a causal claim. 

Alternatively, the primary violation is the use of loaded language, making it Appeal to Emotion (0). 

I think the main issue here is the loaded language, so the classification is 0. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's an Ad Hominem (2) if they're attacking his character. But the statement is about his votes, not directly attacking his character. 

Hmm. Given the options, I'll go with Appeal to Emotion (0) due to the emotionally charged language. So the classification is 0.
