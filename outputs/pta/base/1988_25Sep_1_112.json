    "analysis": "The statement 'Opportunity and peace' lacks a clear conclusion, premise, or logical structure. It does not establish a form (alpha, beta, gamma, delta), substance (fact, value, policy), or lever (connecting relationship). This results in a non-argument, which does not fit any specific fallacy category. However, the absence of a structured argument may align with the 'Slogans' fallacy (5) due to its brevity and lack of reasoning.",
