    "analysis": "The statement uses statistical data to imply President Bush is responsible for health care losses, but the lever (causal connection) is not substantiated. It incorrectly assumes correlation (timing of events) equals causation (Bush's policies caused the loss), violating the FF (Fact-Fact) lever requirement for causal/effect relationships. The argument relies on emotional weight of numbers rather than evidence, but the primary structural violation is False Cause.",
