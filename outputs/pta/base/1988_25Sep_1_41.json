    "analysis": "The statement uses emotional appeal by focusing on the father's fear of injury to evoke sympathy and support for restricting the child's activity. The form is ALPHA (same subject: father), with a Policy (P) conclusion (not allowing play) and a Fact (F) premise (fear of injury). The lever is emotional (fear), which violates the ALPHA constraint requiring evaluative/principled levers for Policy-Fact combinations. This emotional manipulation exploits audience sentiment rather than logical reasoning.",
