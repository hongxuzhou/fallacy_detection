Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework to detect fallacies. Let me start by breaking down the statement step by step.

First, I need to identify the conclusion and premises. The statement seems to be arguing that certain tax policies led to a housing crisis and economic issues. The conclusion might be that these tax policies caused the problems. The premises include slashing taxes on the wealthy, not investing in the middle class, neglecting Wall Street, and creating a perfect storm. Then there's a mention of Donald (probably Trump) supporting the housing crisis.

Next, determining the form. The structure here is a bit complex. The main argument is that tax policies (subject) led to negative outcomes (predicate). But the second part mentions Donald being someone who supported the housing crisis. So maybe the form is a combination of different elements. Let me check the forms again. The primary form here might be Alpha (same subject) or Beta (same predicate). Wait, the first part is about tax policies causing issues, which is a cause-effect relationship. Then the second part is about Donald's role. 

Substance: The first part is about policies, so that's a Policy (P) or Fact (F)? The tax policies are factual statements, so maybe Fact (F). The part about Donald's actions could be a Value (V) or Policy (P). But the main argument is about cause and effect, so substance might be Fact (F) for the policies and then maybe Policy (P) for the claim that Donald supported the crisis.

Levers: The lever here is the connection between the tax policies and the outcomes. The argument is that the policies caused the crisis. But the lever here might be a causal lever. However, the second part introduces Donald, which could be an appeal to authority or ad hominem. Wait, the statement says "Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis." That seems to be attacking Donald's character or actions, implying he supported the crisis. But how does that connect to the main argument?

Wait, the main argument is that tax policies caused the crisis. The mention of Donald might be an ad hominem, attacking his character (as if supporting the crisis is a bad thing) to undermine the argument. But the structure here might be mixing different forms. Let me check the constraints again. 

The first part is about tax policies (subject) causing issues (predicate). The lever here is causal. The second part introduces Donald as someone who supported the crisis. If the argument is trying to say that because Donald supported the crisis, the policies are bad, that might be an ad hominem. But the primary fallacy here might be the false cause or appeal to authority. Wait, the statement says "Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis." This is an attack on Donald's actions, implying that because he supported the crisis, the policies are bad. That could be a tu quoque ad hominem, which is a type of ad hominem. Alternatively, it could be a false cause if they're implying that because Donald supported it, it's a cause. 

Wait, the main argument is that the tax policies caused the crisis. The mention of Donald might be an attempt to associate the policies with someone who supported the crisis, which could be a false cause. But the structure here is more about attacking the person (Donald) rather than the argument. So maybe it's an ad hominem. Let me check the fallacy classification. Ad Hominem (2) includes attacks on the opponent's character or actions. Here, the statement is pointing out that Donald supported the crisis, which could be an attack on his character, implying that his support is a reason to dismiss the argument. But the primary fallacy here might be the false cause if the argument is implying that because Donald supported the crisis, the policies are the cause. However, the main issue is the mention of Donald, which might be an ad hominem. Alternatively, it could be an appeal to authority if they're using Donald's support as an authority, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, the structure might be that the argument is making a causal link between the policies and the crisis, but the mention of Donald is a separate point. However, the primary fallacy here is the ad hominem, attacking Donald's actions rather than addressing the policies. So the classification would be 2 (Ad Hominem). Alternatively, if the argument is using Donald's support as a reason to dismiss the policies, that's an ad hominem. 

Another angle: the statement is making a causal claim (tax policies caused the crisis) but then adds that Donald supported the crisis. This could be an appeal to authority if they're suggesting that because Donald (a figure of authority) supported it, the policies are valid. But that's not the case here. The statement is more about linking the policies to Donald's actions, which might be an ad hominem. 

Wait, the main argument's form is Alpha (same subject, tax policies causing issues). The lever is causal. But the second part introduces a different subject (Donald) and predicate (supported the crisis). This might be a Beta form (same predicate) but not sure. The main issue is that the argument is mixing different elements, but the primary fallacy is the ad hominem. So the classification would be 2.
