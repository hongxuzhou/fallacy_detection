It lacks a lever connecting non-common elements, and its structure resembles a slogan designed to provoke action rather than a logical argument. The absence of a substantive premise leads to a fallacy of appeal to emotion (0) through flag waving, as it evokes group identity (armed forces) to influence the audience.",
