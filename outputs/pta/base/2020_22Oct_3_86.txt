Okay, let's tackle this statement: "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." 

First, I need to break it down. The conclusion seems to be "We're dying with it," and the premise is "he's never said — he said it's dangerous." Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Maybe the premise is that the person (he) hasn't said anything, but then he said it's dangerous. Hmm, maybe there's a contradiction here. 

Looking at the form: The conclusion is about "we" (subject) and the premise is about "he" (another subject). So the form is BETA because the conclusion's subject (we) is linked to the premise's subject (he). But wait, the premise is about what he said, not directly about the conclusion. 

Substance: The conclusion "We're dying with it" is a value statement (V) because it's about the state of being in danger. The premise "he said it's dangerous" is a fact (F) because it's stating what he said. Wait, but the premise is actually a fact about his statement, which is a fact. But the conclusion is a value judgment. 

The lever here is the connection between the premise and the conclusion. The argument is implying that because he said it's dangerous, we are dying with it. But that's a non sequitur. The premise is about a statement, and the conclusion is about a consequence. The lever is missing a proper connection. 

Looking at the valid constraint patterns, BETA requires a similarity or analogy. But here, the premise is about a statement, and the conclusion is about a consequence. The lever is not establishing a legitimate comparison between the two. 

Wait, maybe the form is GAMMA? Because the conclusion is "we're dying" (subject a) and the premise is "he said it's dangerous" (subject b). So a is X because b is Y. That would be GAMMA. But the lever would need to be a parallel relationship. However, the connection between "he said it's dangerous" and "we're dying" isn't a parallel. It's more like a false cause. 

Alternatively, maybe the form is ALPHA. But the conclusion and premise have different subjects. So maybe not. 

The main issue is that the premise is about a statement (he said it's dangerous) and the conclusion is about a consequence (we're dying). There's no valid lever connecting the two. The argument is trying to link the statement to the outcome without proper reasoning. That sounds like a false cause (3) because it's assuming that because he said it's dangerous, we are dying with it. But that's a direct causal link without evidence. 

Wait, but the statement is a bit unclear. The premise might be that he never said anything, but then he said it's dangerous. Maybe the argument is that because he hasn't said anything (contradiction?), we are dying. That's confusing. Alternatively, the structure might be that the premise is that he said it's dangerous, and the conclusion is that we are dying because of that. But the lever is missing. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is using an appeal to authority (1) if "he" is an authority, but the premise is that he said it's dangerous, which is a fact. But the conclusion is a value judgment. 

Wait, the conclusion is "we're dying with it," which is a value statement (V), and the premise is a fact (F). So the form would be V from F, which would require a lever. The lever here is the connection between the fact that he said it's dangerous and the value judgment that we are dying. But that's not a valid lever. The lever should be something like "because he said it's dangerous, we are in danger," but that's not the case here. 

The primary violation is that the lever is not properly connecting the premise to the conclusion. The argument is making a causal link (false cause) without proper justification. So classification would be 3 (False Cause). 

Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to emotion (0) if the language is emotional, but the statement is more about the premise leading to the conclusion. 

But the main issue is the false causal link. So I think the classification is 3.
