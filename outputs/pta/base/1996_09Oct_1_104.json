    "analysis": "The statement equates the structure of the economy (capitalism with incentives) to the universality of the American Dream without establishing a valid lever. The argument assumes a causal relationship (false cause) between economic incentives and the universality of the American Dream, failing to provide a proper evaluative or principled connection. The lever is not justified, leading to a misinterpretation of correlation as causation.",
