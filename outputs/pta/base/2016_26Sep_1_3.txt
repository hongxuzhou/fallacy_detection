Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into conclusion and premises. The statement is: "And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton."

So, the conclusion seems to be that there's no leadership, and that starts with Secretary Clinton. The premises are that with leadership, things would improve quickly, and currently, there's no leadership. 

Now, looking at the form. The first part is saying that if there's leadership (a), then good outcomes (X). Then, the premise is that there's no leadership (a is not Y). The conclusion is that Secretary Clinton is the starting point (a is Z). Wait, maybe the form here is BETA? Because the argument is comparing the current situation (no leadership) to the hypothetical with leadership. But I'm not sure. Let me check the forms again.

The form is about how subjects/predicates are configured. The conclusion is about the lack of leadership leading to Secretary Clinton being the cause. Maybe the form is ALPHA? Or BETA? Let me think. The argument structure might be that because there's no leadership (a is not Y), then the problem starts with Secretary Clinton (a is Z). But that might not fit the forms exactly.

Looking at substance: the premises are about leadership (a subject) and the outcome (X), which is a value (V) or policy (P)? The conclusion is about the cause being Secretary Clinton, which is a person. The lever here is the connection between the lack of leadership and Secretary Clinton. The lever is implied to be that Secretary Clinton is responsible for the lack of leadership. 

Now, checking the constraints. For the form, if it's BETA (a is X because b is X), then there needs to be a comparison. But here, the argument isn't comparing two different entities. Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause (3) because it's implying that the lack of leadership is due to Secretary Clinton, which might be a causal link without sufficient evidence. 

Wait, the statement says "that starts with Secretary Clinton." So the argument is that the lack of leadership (which is the problem) is because of Secretary Clinton. This could be an appeal to authority (1) if they're attributing the cause to a person without evidence. But maybe it's a false cause (3) because they're assuming that the lack of leadership is directly caused by Secretary Clinton, which might not be the case. 

Alternatively, it could be an ad hominem (2) if they're attacking Secretary Clinton's character. But the statement isn't attacking her directly, just saying that the problem starts with her. Wait, the original statement says "we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton." So the argument is that the absence of leadership is due to Secretary Clinton. That seems like a causal link without evidence. So maybe False Cause (3) because it's assuming that the lack of leadership is caused by Secretary Clinton, which is a correlation being mistaken for causation. 

Alternatively, it could be an appeal to authority if they're saying that because Secretary Clinton is an authority, the lack of leadership is her fault. But I think the main issue here is the false cause. The statement is making a causal connection between Secretary Clinton and the lack of leadership without providing evidence, which fits False Cause (3). 

Another angle: the form might be ALPHA (a is X because a is Y). The conclusion is that there's no leadership (a is not Y), and the premise is that with leadership, things would be better (a is X). But the lever is connecting the lack of leadership to Secretary Clinton. So maybe the form is not matching. The lever here is the connection between the absence of leadership and the person (Secretary Clinton), which might not be a valid lever. 

Wait, the lever for ALPHA requires evaluative or principled levers. But here, the lever is a causal one. So if the form is ALPHA, then the lever should be causal, but the argument is not properly connecting the premises. Maybe the primary violation is False Cause (3) because the argument assumes that the lack of leadership is caused by Secretary Clinton without sufficient evidence. 

So the classification would be 3 (False Cause).
