Okay, let's tackle this statement: "If I become president, I'll get America working again." 

First, I need to break it down. The conclusion here is the claim that the speaker will get America working again if they become president. The premise is the conditional statement about becoming president.

Now, looking at the form. The structure seems to be a conditional statement where the subject (the speaker) is linked to the outcome (America working again) through the premise of becoming president. But according to the PTA framework, the forms are alpha, beta, gamma, delta. Let me see which one fits. 

The form here is "If a becomes X, then a will achieve Y." Wait, the original form examples are ALPHA (a is X because a is Y), BETA (a is X because b is X), etc. This statement is a conditional, so maybe it's a different structure. But the key is to determine the lever. 

The lever here is the connection between becoming president (the premise) and getting America working again (the conclusion). The substance of the premise is a policy (P) because it's about a proposed action (becoming president). The conclusion is also a policy (P) since it's about achieving a state. 

Wait, the lever is the relationship between the premise and conclusion. The speaker is asserting that becoming president (a policy action) will lead to America working again (a state). But according to the valid constraint patterns, for a form like ALPHA (same subject), the lever should be causal or effect if both are facts, or evaluative if values. But here, the premise is a policy (P) and the conclusion is a policy (P) as well. 

Wait, the form might be alpha because the subject (the speaker) is the same in both the premise and conclusion. But the premise is "if I become president" (which is a conditional, not a statement about the speaker's current state), so maybe it's not alpha. Alternatively, maybe it's a different form. 

Alternatively, looking at the lever: the connection is that the action (becoming president) will cause the outcome (America working again). The lever here is a causal relationship. But according to the valid constraints for alpha, if both are policy (P), then the lever should be evaluative or principled. However, the speaker is making a causal claim (causal lever) without providing evidence. 

But wait, the valid constraint for alpha (same subject) when substance is policy (P) requires evaluative or principled levers. However, the speaker is using a causal lever (if I do X, then Y happens). That's a false cause fallacy (3) because it's assuming causation without proper evidence. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a slippery slope? No, because it's not a chain of events leading to an exaggerated outcome. It's more of a direct claim that the action will cause the outcome. 

So the primary violation is using a causal lever (false cause) without proper justification. The speaker is asserting that becoming president will directly lead to America working again, which is a causal claim (lever) but there's no evidence provided. So this would fall under False Cause (3). 

Another angle: the statement is a policy claim (P) based on a policy action (P). The lever is causal, which might not be appropriate for the form. Since the form isn't clearly alpha or beta, but the lever is causal, which is not aligned with the required lever types for the substance. 

Therefore, the classification is 3 (False Cause).
