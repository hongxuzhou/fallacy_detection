    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('very unfair', 'average taxpayer') to evoke sympathy rather than providing a logical connection between the premise (taxpayers paying on time) and the conclusion (it's unfair to let money go uncollected). The lever is not a valid criterion or definition but relies on emotional appeal, violating the constraint for value-based arguments.",
