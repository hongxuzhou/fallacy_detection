    "analysis": "The statement 'A promise made will be a promise kept' presents a tautological assertion where the conclusion (a promise kept) is logically equivalent to the premise (a promise made). This results in a structural violation of the PTA framework's constraint patterns. The form is alpha (same subject), and the lever (connection between non-common elements) is absent or circular, leading to a false causal implication without justification. This aligns with the False Cause fallacy (3) as it misinterprets a correlation (making a promise) as a causation (keeping it) without evidence.",
