Okay, let's tackle this statement: "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." 

First, I need to break it down. The conclusion here is that the policy or action in question is bad for the economy. The premise is that 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates have said so.

Now, looking at the PTA framework. The form here seems to be BETA because the conclusion is about "it" (the policy) being bad, and the premise is about economists (b) saying the same. So the structure is a is X because b is X. 

Substance: The conclusion is a value judgment (V) since it's about whether something is good or bad. The premise is also a value statement (V) because it's about the economists' opinion. 

The lever here is the authority of the economists. The argument is relying on the authority of these experts. But according to the DELTA constraints, if it's a DELTA form (which it might not be), Z should be a legitimate acceptability indicator. However, the form here is BETA, not DELTA. 

Wait, the form is BETA (a is X because b is X). For BETA, the lever should be similarity, analogy, or equality. The argument is trying to say that because these experts (b) say it's bad, then the policy (a) is bad. But the lever here is the authority of the experts, not a similarity or analogy. 

So the lever is an appeal to authority, which is a fallacy. The statement is using the authority of the economists (even though they are experts) to support the conclusion. But according to the constraints, for BETA, the lever should be similarity or analogy. However, the argument is using the authority of the experts, which is more aligned with DELTA. 

Wait, maybe the form is actually DELTA? Let me check. DELTA is when q is acceptable because q is Z. But here, the conclusion is that the policy is bad (a value), not about acceptability. So maybe the form is BETA. 

But the lever is using the authority of the experts, which is an appeal to authority. According to the fallacy list, Appeal to Authority (1) is when an authority is cited without relevant evidence. Even though the economists are experts, the argument is not providing evidence but relying on their authority. So this would be Appeal to Authority (1). 

Wait, but the PTA constraints for BETA require similarity/analogy. Since the argument is using the authority of the experts (not similarity), this is a violation. So the lever is not a similarity but an appeal to authority. Therefore, the fallacy is Appeal to Authority (1). 

So the primary violation is using authority as the lever when the form is BETA, which requires similarity. Therefore, the classification is 1.
