Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework to detect fallacies. Let me start by breaking down the statement.

The statement is: "But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed."

First, I need to identify the conclusion and premises. The conclusion seems to be that "it won't be possible to do" (probably referring to some policy or action), and the premise is that Senator D'Amato, a campaign co-chair, says Medicare cuts will be more than the vetoed bill.

Next, determine the form. The structure here is comparing two things: the tax scheme passing leading to Medicare cuts. The subject here might be the tax scheme (a) and the Medicare cuts (b). The form seems to be BETA because it's using a comparison between the tax scheme and the Medicare cuts via the co-chair's statement. Wait, maybe it's a different form. Let me check again.

Wait, the structure is: If the tax scheme passes (A), then Medicare cuts will be more (B). The premise is that the co-chair says B. So maybe the form is BETA, where A is X because B is X? Or is it a different form? Let me think. The form is about how the subjects/predicates are configured. The conclusion is about the tax scheme passing leading to something, and the premise is about the co-chair's statement. Maybe the form is BETA, where the conclusion is about the tax scheme (A) leading to Medicare cuts (B), and the premise is that the co-chair (another entity) says B. Hmm, maybe the form is BETA because it's comparing the tax scheme's effect to the Medicare cuts, using the co-chair's statement as a lever.

Now, substance: The conclusion is about the possibility of doing something (maybe a policy), so that's a Policy (P) statement. The premise is about a statement from a co-chair, which is a fact (F) or value (V)? The premise is a statement about what will happen if the tax scheme passes, which is a prediction, so maybe a Fact (F) or Policy (P)? Wait, the premise is a claim about the outcome (Medicare cuts), which is a policy or a fact. But the conclusion is about the possibility of doing something, which is a policy. So the substance of the premise might be a Fact (F) if it's about the cuts, but the conclusion is a Policy (P). 

The lever here is the co-chair's statement. The argument is using the co-chair's assertion as a reason to believe that the tax scheme will lead to more Medicare cuts. But according to the BETA form, which is a is X because b is X, the lever should be similarity, analogy, or equality. However, the co-chair is an authority figure, so maybe this is an Appeal to Authority (1). Wait, the lever here is the co-chair's statement. If the argument is using the co-chair's authority as a reason, that's Appeal to Authority. But the form might be BETA, where the premise is that the co-chair (b) says something (X), and the conclusion is that the tax scheme (a) will lead to something (X). Wait, maybe the form is BETA because it's comparing the tax scheme (a) to the Medicare cuts (b), using the co-chair's statement as a lever. But the lever here is the co-chair's authority, which might be a fallacy.

Looking at the constraints for BETA: requires similarity/analogy/equality levers. The lever here is the co-chair's statement, which is an authority. However, the BETA form requires a comparison between a and b. If the argument is that the tax scheme (a) will lead to Medicare cuts (b) because the co-chair (b) says so, maybe the form isn't BETA. Alternatively, maybe the form is ALPHA? Wait, the conclusion is about the tax scheme passing leading to something, so maybe the form is ALPHA (a is X because a is Y). But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the form might be GAMMA (a is X because b is Y). The conclusion is that the tax scheme passing (a) leads to Medicare cuts (X), and the premise is that the co-chair (b) says Medicare cuts will be more (Y). So the lever is the co-chair's statement, which is a different subject. So GAMMA requires parallel relationships: a:b as X:Y. But here, the co-chair is a different entity, so maybe the lever is the co-chair's statement indicating that the tax scheme will lead to Medicare cuts. But the lever is not a parallel relationship. 

Alternatively, the lever is the co-chair's authority, which is an appeal to authority (fallacy 1). The argument is using the co-chair's statement as a reason, but the co-chair is not an expert on Medicare cuts. So this would be an Appeal to Authority (1). 

Wait, the statement is structured as: If the tax scheme passes, then it won't be possible to do something (the conclusion). The premise is that the co-chair says Medicare cuts will be more than the vetoed bill. The argument is that because the co-chair (an authority) says this, the tax scheme will lead to more cuts, making the original action impossible. The lever here is the co-chair's authority, which is an appeal to authority. So the fallacy is Appeal to Authority (1). 

But let me check the constraints again. If the form is BETA, which requires similarity/analogy, but the lever is an authority, which is not a similarity. Therefore, the lever violates the BETA constraint, leading to Appeal to Authority. 

So the classification would be 1 (Appeal to Authority). The primary violation is using an authority (co-chair) without proper evidence, which is a classic Appeal to Authority fallacy.
