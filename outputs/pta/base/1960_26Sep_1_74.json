    "analysis": "The statement implies that the committee's formation (a) is effective (X) because the price line has been held well (Y). This is a GAMMA form (a is X because b is Y) requiring parallel relationships. However, the lever is a causal assumption (committee caused price stability) without establishing a proportional or analogous relationship between the committee and the price line. The argument mistakenly infers causation from correlation, violating the constraint for GAMMA forms.",
