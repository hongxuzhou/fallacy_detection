    "analysis": "The statement 'They were with the drug companies.' lacks a clear premise-conclusion structure and fails to establish a valid lever connecting 'they' and 'drug companies.' The form appears to be a beta (a is X because b is X), but no similarity, analogy, or equality is provided to justify the association. The substance is a fact (F), but the lever is missing, leading to an unsupported claim. This is a structural violation of the beta form's requirement for a legitimate comparison, which could be interpreted as a False Cause (3) due to the implied causal link between association with drug companies and an unstated outcome.",
