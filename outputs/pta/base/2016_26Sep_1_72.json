    "analysis": "The argument compares the Obama administration's debt increase to the current debt level, implying a causal link between the debt amount and the feasibility of actions. The form is BETA (a is X because b is X), but the lever (comparison) lacks legitimate analogy or similarity. The conclusion (policy) is unsupported by the premise (fact) due to an unwarranted causal assumption, violating the required similarity/analogy lever for BETA. This aligns with False Cause (3) as it misinterprets correlation (debt increase) as causation (inability to act).",
