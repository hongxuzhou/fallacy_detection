    "analysis": "The statement uses a personal anecdote (friend's experience) to argue that racial profiling can't occur in America today. The form is Beta (a specific case used to generalize about America), but the lever relies on emotional appeal (evoking fear and empathy) rather than logical connection. The conclusion (value judgment about America) is improperly supported by a single instance, violating the requirement for evaluative/principled levers in Alpha form. The primary violation is emotional manipulation to bypass rational analysis.",
