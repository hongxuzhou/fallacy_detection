    "analysis": "The statement 'It's a racist place' presents a value judgment (V) without any supporting premises or evidence. The lever is missing, as there is no connection established between the subject ('it') and the predicate ('racist'). The emotionally charged term 'racist' is used without substantiation, violating the structural constraint of requiring a valid lever. This constitutes an appeal to emotion by leveraging emotionally loaded language to evoke a reaction without factual basis.",
