Okay, let's tackle this statement: "And that's hopeful, and that's positive." 

First, I need to break it down. The user wants me to analyze using the Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA) framework. Let me recall the steps: identify conclusion and premises, determine form, substance, lever, check constraints, and find fallacies.

The statement is a bit vague. It seems like it's expressing that something is hopeful and positive. But there's no clear argument structure here. Let me check if there's a conclusion and premise. Maybe the conclusion is that something is hopeful and positive, but what's the premise? The statement doesn't provide any supporting reasons. 

Looking at the form: the structure is about the same subject (the thing being described) with two predicates (hopeful and positive). So maybe it's an alpha form? But alpha requires a connection between the subject and predicate. However, the statement doesn't link these adjectives to any supporting evidence or reasoning. 

Substance: The adjectives "hopeful" and "positive" are value judgments (V). So the substance is Value (V). 

The lever here is the connection between the subject and the predicates. But since there's no premise provided, there's no actual lever. The statement is just stating the conclusion without any reasoning. 

According to the constraints, for a value statement (V), the lever should be evaluative or principled. But here, there's no lever. The statement is just emotional language without any basis. That might be an appeal to emotion (0), using loaded language to evoke positive feelings without substantive argument. 

Alternatively, since there's no form (no premises), maybe it's a fallacy of begging the question or something else. But in the given fallacy list, Appeal to Emotion (0) fits here. The statement uses emotional terms ("hopeful," "positive") to influence the audience without providing evidence, which is a classic appeal to emotion. 

So the primary violation is using emotional language without a valid lever, leading to classification 0.
