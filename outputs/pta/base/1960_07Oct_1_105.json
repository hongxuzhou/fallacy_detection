    "analysis": "The statement 'We have to practice what we preach' is a concise, emotionally charged phrase designed to provoke immediate agreement. It lacks a formal argument structure with explicit premises and conclusion. The form is not clearly defined as it doesn't follow the PTA's structured argument patterns. The substance is a value statement (V), but the lever is implied through emotional appeal rather than logical connection. The primary violation is the use of a slogan to evoke emotional response without substantive reasoning.",
