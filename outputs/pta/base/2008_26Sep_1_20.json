    "analysis": "The argument presents a conclusion (Senator Obama's plan is dangerous) supported by a premise (Admiral Mullen suggests it). The form is Beta (a is X because b is X), where the conclusion about the plan (a) is based on Admiral Mullen's suggestion (b). The lever is an appeal to authority (Admiral Mullen's status), which violates Beta's requirement for similarity/analogy/equality levers. The argument improperly uses an authority's opinion as evidence without establishing a legitimate comparison or causal link.",
