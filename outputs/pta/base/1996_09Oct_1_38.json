    "analysis": "The argument compares Abraham Lincoln and Bob Dole to assert Lincoln wouldn't support ending affirmative action as Dole did. This is a BETA form (a is X because b is X) with a Value (V) conclusion. The lever relies on an analogy between two historically distinct figures, which lacks legitimate comparison. The comparison is invalid due to differing contexts (19th-century vs. 20th-century politics), violating the BETA form's requirement for a valid similarity/analogy. This is a False Cause (3) fallacy as it misinterprets a correlation (Dole's position) as a causal link (Lincoln's hypothetical stance).",
