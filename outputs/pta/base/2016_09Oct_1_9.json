    "analysis": "The statement reports Bernie Sanders' claim about Hillary Clinton's judgment but lacks a valid logical connection. The form is beta (a is X because b is X), where the premise (Bernie's statement) is used to assert the conclusion (Hillary's judgment). The lever is an appeal to authority (Bernie's credibility), which violates the beta constraint requiring similarity/analogy/equality levers. This constitutes an Appeal to Authority (1).",
