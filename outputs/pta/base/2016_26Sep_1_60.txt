Okay, let's tackle this statement. First, I need to break it down. The user is asking about identifying fallacies using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. The statement given is: "These are people that are bad people that shouldn't beâ€”when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk."

Alright, starting with the analysis procedure. Step 1: Identify conclusion and premises. The conclusion seems to be that "you have to have stop-and-frisk" in Chicago, especially since Obama's presidency started. The premises are the statistics about shootings and deaths in Chicago during his presidency.

Next, determine the form. The form here is comparing the situation in Chicago (subject) to the need for stop-and-frisk (predicate). The structure seems to be BETA, where the conclusion about Chicago (a is X) is based on the situation in another context (b is X). Wait, but the form is BETA (a is X because b is X). But in this case, the argument is that because there are a lot of shootings and deaths in Chicago (during Obama's time), stop-and-frisk is necessary. So the form is BETA, where the premise is about Chicago's situation, and the conclusion is about needing stop-and-frisk. But the lever here is the comparison between the high crime rate and the need for stop-and-frisk. 

Now, substance. The premise is about factual data (number of shootings and deaths), so that's Fact (F). The conclusion is a policy recommendation (stop-and-frisk), which is Policy (P). So the form is BETA, and the substances are F and P. 

According to the valid constraint patterns for BETA, when the premise is a fact (F) and the conclusion is a policy (P), the lever should be similarity, analogy, or equality. But the argument here is that because there are high crime rates (F), stop-and-frisk (P) is necessary. The lever is the assumption that high crime rates justify stop-and-frisk. However, the problem is that the lever is not a legitimate comparison. The argument is not establishing a similarity or analogy between the situation and the policy. Instead, it's a direct causal link, which might be a False Cause (3) because it's implying that the high crime rate (F) causes the need for stop-and-frisk (P), but without proper justification. Wait, but the form is BETA, which requires similarity or analogy. If the lever is not a proper comparison, then it's a fallacy. Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to authority or something else.

Wait, looking at the fallacies: False Cause (3) is when correlation is mistaken for causation. The argument here might be that high crime rates (F) lead to the need for stop-and-frisk (P), but that's a causal link. However, the structure is BETA, which requires similarity. So the lever is not a similarity but a causal link. That would be a violation of the BETA form's constraints, which require similarity/analogy. So this would be a fallacy. But what's the classification? The options are 0-5. Let me check the fallacy types again.

False Cause (3) is about misinterpreting correlation as causation. The argument here might be implying that because there are many shootings (F), stop-and-frisk (P) is necessary, which is a causal link. However, the form is BETA, which requires a similarity or analogy. If the lever is not a similarity but a causal link, that's a violation of the BETA constraints. But the primary fallacy here might be False Cause (3), because the argument is suggesting that the high crime rate (F) directly leads to the need for stop-and-frisk (P), which is a causal claim without proper evidence. Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to authority, but the statement doesn't mention any authority. 

Alternatively, the structure could be Gamma (a is X because b is Y), where the premise is about the crime rate (F) and the conclusion is about stop-and-frisk (P). But the lever would be the parallel relationship. However, the form is BETA, which is a is X because b is X. Wait, the original argument is that because there are high crime rates (a is X), stop-and-frisk is needed (a is Y). Wait, maybe the form is not BETA. Let me clarify.

The conclusion is "you have to have stop-and-frisk" (a is X). The premise is "there are 3,000 shootings..." (a is Y). So the form is ALPHA, where the same subject (Chicago) is being discussed. Wait, ALPHA is when the subject is the same. So the form would be ALPHA, where the conclusion is that stop-and-frisk is necessary (X) because there are high crime rates (Y). But the substance of the premise is F (fact), and the conclusion is P (policy). According to the ALPHA constraints, for FF, you need causal/effect levers. VF requires criterion/definition. VV/PF/PV require evaluative/principled levers. Here, the premise is F, conclusion is P. So the lever should be evaluative or principled. But the argument is using the fact of high crime to justify a policy. The lever here is the assumption that high crime necessitates stop-and-frisk, which is a causal link. But the lever is not evaluative or principled. So this would be a violation of the ALPHA constraints for F to P. The correct lever for F to P would be a criterion or definition, but the argument is using a causal link, which is a False Cause (3) fallacy. Therefore, the classification would be 3.

Alternatively, maybe the form is BETA, but I'm not sure. Let me recheck. The conclusion is about Chicago (a) needing stop-and-frisk (X), and the premise is about the same subject (Chicago) having high crime (Y). So it's the same subject, so ALPHA. So the form is ALPHA. The premise is F, conclusion is P. So the lever should be evaluative or principled. But the argument is using a causal link (high crime leads to need for stop-and-frisk). That's a False Cause (3) fallacy. Hence, the classification is 3.
