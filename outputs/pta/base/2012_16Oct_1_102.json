    "analysis": "The statement presents a causal claim (lever) without evidence, asserting that becoming president (policy action) will directly cause America to 'work again' (policy outcome). This violates the constraint that policy-to-policy arguments require evaluative/principled levers, not unverified causal assumptions. The structure resembles a false cause fallacy by implying a direct causal relationship without justification.",
