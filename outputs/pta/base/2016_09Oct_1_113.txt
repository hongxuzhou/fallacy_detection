Okay, let's tackle this statement: "And my whole concept was to make America great again." 

First, I need to break it down. The user wants me to analyze this using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. Let me recall the steps: identify conclusion and premises, determine form, substance, lever, check constraints, and find fallacies.

So the statement is a bit of a slogan. The speaker is stating their concept as "making America great again." Let me think about the components. The conclusion here is probably the idea that their concept is to make America great again. But what's the premise? The statement doesn't seem to have an explicit premise; it's more of a declaration. 

Looking at the form: The subject here is "my whole concept" and the predicate is "to make America great again." So it's a single statement, not comparing two things. The form might be alpha or gamma? Wait, the forms are based on how subjects and predicates are configured. Alpha is same subject, beta same predicate, gamma different. Since the statement is a single assertion, maybe it's a different form. But the PTA framework's forms are about how the argument is structured between premises and conclusion. 

Substance: The statement is a value judgment. "Great again" is a value, so substance is Value (V). 

The lever here is the connection between the concept and the goal. But the lever is implied. The statement doesn't provide a logical connection between the concept and the outcome. It's more of a slogan. 

Looking at the valid constraint patterns, the delta form is about acceptability based on Z. But this doesn't fit. The statement is more of a value statement. 

Now, checking for fallacies. The statement is a slogan, which is classified as fallacy 5. Slogans are brief, striking phrases used to provoke excitement, often with repetition. The statement "Make America Great Again" is a well-known slogan, and it's used to evoke emotional responses without providing substantial argument. 

The user mentioned that the primary violation is the use of a slogan, which falls under classification 5. Even though there might be other elements, the main issue here is the slogan itself. 

So, the analysis would point out that the statement is a slogan, hence the classification is 5.
