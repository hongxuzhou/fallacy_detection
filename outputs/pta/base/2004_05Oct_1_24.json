    "analysis": "The statement references George Tenet's testimony as a specific example but lacks a clear conclusion or lever connecting the premise to a claim. The form is ambiguous, and the substance (fact about testimony) is not linked to a value or policy judgment. The lever is missing, and the argument appears to rely on the authority of Tenet without establishing relevance or causal connection, violating the constraints for a valid alpha or beta form.",
