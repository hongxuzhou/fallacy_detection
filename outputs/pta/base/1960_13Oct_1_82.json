    "analysis": "The statement compares the current policy to Truman's past actions to imply inflationary outcomes. This is a Beta form (a is X because b is X) with Policy (P) substance. The lever relies on an analogy to Truman's situation, but the comparison lacks legitimate justification (no similarity in economic conditions or mechanisms). The argument assumes equivalence without establishing valid parallels, violating Beta's requirement for a legitimate comparison. This is a False Cause (3) fallacy, as it misattributes causation through an invalid analogy.",
