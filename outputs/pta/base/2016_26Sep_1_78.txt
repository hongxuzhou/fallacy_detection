Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into its components: conclusion, premises, form, substance, lever, and check for fallacies.

The statement is: "In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, overâ€”almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed."

Hmm, the main point here seems to be that there have been almost 4,000 killings in Chicago since Obama became president. The speaker is probably trying to make a point about crime rates or Obama's policies. But wait, the structure here might be an argument. Let me identify the form.

The form is about comparing the number of killings in Chicago under Obama's presidency. The subject here is Chicago, and the predicate is the number of deaths. The form seems to be Alpha (same subject) because the subject is the same (Chicago) and the predicate is about the number of killings. But the premise is that there are thousands killed, and the conclusion is that almost 4,000 have been killed since Obama became president. Wait, maybe the form is Beta? Or maybe it's just a factual statement.

Wait, the structure here might be that the speaker is using the number of killings as a premise to support some conclusion, but the statement itself doesn't have an explicit conclusion. Wait, maybe the statement is just presenting a fact, but perhaps the implication is that Obama is responsible? Or is there an implied argument?

Wait, the original statement might be a premise leading to a conclusion. But the way it's phrased, it's just stating the fact. Let me recheck. The user says to identify conclusion and premises. But the statement as given is just a factual claim. However, maybe the argument is that because there were so many killings, Obama is responsible. But the statement itself doesn't have an explicit conclusion. Wait, maybe the statement is part of a larger argument, but the user is only providing this statement. So maybe the analysis is about the structure of the statement as a standalone argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is that since Obama was president, and there were 4,000 killings, therefore something about his policies. But the statement as given doesn't have an explicit conclusion. However, maybe the structure is that the speaker is using the number of killings (fact) to imply something else. But without a clear conclusion, it's hard to see. Wait, maybe the statement is a premise in a larger argument, but the user is only giving this part. 

Alternatively, maybe the form here is Alpha (same subject), where the subject is Chicago, and the predicate is the number of deaths. The substance is Fact (F) because it's stating a factual claim. The lever would be the connection between the number of deaths and the time period (since Obama became president). But the problem here is that the statement is just stating the fact. However, if there's an implied conclusion, like "Therefore, Obama's policies are ineffective," then the form would be Alpha, but the lever would need to be a causal or evaluative one. But the statement itself doesn't have an explicit conclusion. 

Wait, maybe the structure is that the speaker is using the fact of high crime in Chicago (which is a fact) to argue that Obama is responsible, but the statement itself is just the premise. However, the user's instruction says to identify conclusion and premises. If the statement is just a premise, then maybe there's no conclusion. But perhaps the conclusion is implied. However, the user's example might be different. Let me try again.

Looking at the structure: The statement is a factual statement about the number of deaths in Chicago since Obama's presidency. The form could be Alpha (same subject, same predicate? Or different?) Wait, the form is determined by how the subjects and predicates are configured. The subject is Chicago, and the predicate is the number of killings. So the form is Alpha (same subject) with the same subject, but different predicates? Wait, maybe the form is Gamma? Because the premise is about the number of killings in Chicago, and the conclusion is also about the same subject. Wait, perhaps the form is Alpha, but the lever is the time period (since Obama became president). 

But the key here is the lever. The lever connects the non-common elements. In this case, the non-common elements are the time period (since Obama became president) and the number of deaths. The lever would be the implication that the time period (Obama's presidency) is connected to the number of deaths. However, the lever here is not a causal or evaluative one. The statement is just stating a correlation between the time period and the number of deaths. But the problem is that the speaker might be implying a causal relationship (that Obama's policies caused the deaths), which is a False Cause (3) fallacy. 

Wait, the statement itself is just stating a fact. However, if the argument is that because there were 4,000 deaths during Obama's presidency, then Obama is responsible, that would be a False Cause. But the statement as given doesn't have that conclusion. However, maybe the statement is part of an argument where the conclusion is implied. But the user is only providing this statement. 

Alternatively, the statement is a factual statement, but the way it's presented might be an appeal to emotion (0) by using the number of deaths to evoke fear or pity. But the statement doesn't use emotional language, just facts. 

Wait, the statement says "almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president." The key here is that the speaker is using the time period (Obama's presidency) to correlate with the number of deaths. However, the lever here is the time period. But if the argument is that Obama's presidency caused the deaths, that's a False Cause. But if the statement is just stating the fact, then it's not an argument. However, if the argument is that because Obama was president during that time, the deaths are his fault, then that's False Cause. 

But the user's instruction is to analyze the statement as given. The statement itself is just a factual claim. However, the way it's phrased might be an appeal to emotion. The number "4,000" is a large number, which could be used to evoke fear. But the statement doesn't use emotional language, just presents the fact. 

Wait, the user's example might be different. Let me check the fallacy types again. Appeal to emotion (0) includes loaded language, fear, pity, etc. The statement here is stating a fact, but the number might be used to evoke fear. However, the statement itself is just presenting the fact. 

Alternatively, the statement could be an example of False Cause (3) if the argument is implying that Obama's policies caused the deaths. But again, the statement itself doesn't make that implication. 

Wait, maybe the structure is Alpha (same subject) with a fact (F) and the lever is the time period. But the lever is not a causal or evaluative one. Wait, the lever for Alpha form requires for FF: causal/effect/sign levers. But if the substance is F (fact), then the lever should be causal or effect. However, the statement is just stating the fact, so maybe there's no lever. 

Alternatively, if the argument is that because there are many deaths (F), then something else (like Obama's policies) is bad (V), then the lever would be evaluative. But the statement itself is just a fact. 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it again. 

Conclusion: The conclusion is not explicitly stated. The statement is just a premise. But if the argument is that Obama's policies are bad because there were many deaths, then the form would be Alpha (same subject: Chicago, predicate: deaths), and the lever would be the causal relationship between Obama's presidency and the deaths. But that's a False Cause (3) because it's assuming causation from correlation. 

Alternatively, if the argument is that since Obama was president during that time, and there were many deaths, then the deaths are his fault, that's False Cause. 

But the user's statement doesn't have an explicit conclusion. However, the way it's phrased might be part of an argument where the conclusion is implied. 

In that case, the primary fallacy would be False Cause (3) because the argument assumes that the time period (Obama's presidency) is the cause of the deaths, which is a correlation without establishing causation. 

Alternatively, if the argument is using the number of deaths to evoke fear, that's Appeal to Emotion (0). But the statement itself doesn't use emotional language, just presents the fact. 

So between False Cause and Appeal to Emotion. Which is more likely? The statement is a factual claim, but if it's used to imply that Obama is responsible, then it's False Cause. But the statement as given is just stating the fact. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to analyze the statement as given. The statement is just stating the fact. So maybe there's no fallacy here. But the user might be implying that the statement is part of an argument. 

Alternatively, the statement might be an example of a False Cause because it's correlating the time period with the deaths without establishing causation. 

In that case, the classification would be 3 (False Cause). 

But I need to make sure. Let me check the PTA constraints again. 

For Alpha form (same subject), the lever for FF (Fact to Fact) requires causal/effect/sign levers. If the argument is that the number of deaths (F) is because of Obama's presidency (F), then the lever would be causal. But the statement is just stating the fact, not making a causal claim. 

But if the argument is that because there were many deaths (F), then Obama's policies are bad (V), then the lever would be evaluative. But the statement is just a fact. 

So perhaps the statement is not an argument but a fact. Therefore, no fallacy. However, the user might be considering the implication. 

Alternatively, the statement might be an example of Appeal to Emotion (0) by using the large number to evoke fear. 

But the statement doesn't use emotional language, just presents the fact. So maybe not. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the primary violation is False Cause (3) because the statement is correlating the time period with the deaths, implying causation. 

Alternatively, the structure is Alpha (same subject, Chicago), with two facts (number of deaths). But the lever is the time period. Since the lever is not a causal or effect, but just a time frame, that's a violation. 

Wait, in Alpha form, for FF, the lever must be causal/effect/sign. But if the argument is that the number of deaths is because of the time period (Obama's presidency), then the lever is a causal one. However, the statement is just stating the fact, not making a causal claim. 

I think the key here is that the statement is a factual claim, but if it's used to imply causation, then it's False Cause. However, without an explicit conclusion, it's hard to say. 

Given the options, I think the primary fallacy here is False Cause (3), because the statement is using the correlation between the time period and the number of deaths to imply causation, which is a fallacy.
