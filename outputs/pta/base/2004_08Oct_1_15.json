    "analysis": "The statement attacks the president's character (labeling them as 'wishy-washy' and 'flip-flopper') based on their actions, rather than addressing the actual argument. This is a classic ad hominem fallacy (sub-type: name-calling) where the speaker dismisses the opponent's position by attacking their character rather than engaging with the substance of their arguments. The lever here is the emotional label applied to the president, which violates the constraint that arguments must connect non-common elements through valid evaluative or principled relationships.",
