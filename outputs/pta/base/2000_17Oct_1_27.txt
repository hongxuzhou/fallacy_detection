Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into its components.

The statement is: "And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration."

Hmm, the conclusion here seems to be that the current number is the smallest since Kennedy's time. The premise is that it's the smallest number since then. Wait, but the structure might be a bit off. Let me check the form. The subject here is "it" (the number), and the predicate is about being the smallest. The comparison is to the time of JFK's administration. 

Looking at the form, it's a comparison between two different time periods. The form would be BETA (a is X because b is X), where a is the current situation and b is JFK's time. But the substance here is a fact (F) because it's stating a numerical comparison. 

The lever here is the comparison between the current number and the past. But the problem is that the statement is using a comparison without establishing a legitimate basis for similarity. The lever is supposed to be a similarity or analogy, but the statement doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning that connects the current situation to JFK's time in a way that justifies the comparison. 

Wait, the statement might be using a false cause or a slippery slope? No, maybe it's an appeal to emotion or authority? Wait, the main issue here is that the comparison is made without proper justification. The lever isn't valid because there's no established similarity or analogy between the two periods. The statement is just stating that it's the smallest since then, but without any supporting evidence or reasoning. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause because it's implying that the current situation is the smallest because of some causal link to the past. But the form is more about comparison. Let me check the constraints again. For BETA (a is X because b is X), the lever must be similarity or analogy. Here, the lever is a time-based comparison, but the statement doesn't establish that the two periods are comparable in the relevant aspects. 

So the primary violation is that the lever isn't a legitimate comparison. The statement is making a comparison without proper basis, which might fall under the False Cause (3) or Appeal to Authority (1)? Wait, no. The main issue here is that the lever is a comparison between two different times without showing that they are analogous. The fallacy here might be a false cause, but according to the constraints, BETA requires similarity/analogy. So the lever is missing, leading to a violation. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to emotion? The statement is trying to evoke a sense of history or nostalgia, but that's not the primary issue. The main problem is the lack of a valid comparison. So the classification would be False Cause (3) because it's misinterpreting correlation (time) as causation? Wait, no. The statement isn't claiming a direct cause but is making a comparison. 

Wait, maybe the lever is a temporal comparison, but the form is BETA, which requires similarity. The statement is comparing two different time periods without showing that they are similar in the relevant aspects. Therefore, the lever is invalid, leading to a fallacy. The primary violation is the lever not being a legitimate comparison, which might be a False Cause (3) if it's implying that the current situation is the smallest because of some causal link to the past. Alternatively, maybe it's an Appeal to Authority (1) if it's implying that because it's since JFK's time, it's valid. 

Wait, the statement is just stating that it's the smallest since then. The lever is the time period. But there's no evidence that the comparison is valid. So the primary violation is that the lever is not a legitimate comparison. The constraints for BETA require similarity/analogy, which is missing. So this would be a violation of the BETA form's lever requirement. 

Looking back at the fallacy list, the primary classification here would be False Cause (3) if it's misinterpreting correlation as causation. But the statement isn't about causation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Slippery Slope (4)? No, that's about a chain of events. 

Wait, the main issue is that the lever is not properly established. The statement is making a comparison without showing that the two periods are similar enough. So this is a case of an invalid lever for a BETA form. The fallacy would be False Cause (3) if the comparison is being used to imply a causal relationship. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be an Appeal to Emotion (0) if the statement is trying to evoke a sense of history. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a False Cause (3) because the statement is implying that the current situation is the smallest because of some correlation with the past, but without proper evidence. 

I think the primary violation is the lever not being a valid comparison, which would fall under the False Cause (3) fallacy. So the classification is 3.
