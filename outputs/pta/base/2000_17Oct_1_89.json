    "analysis": "The statement implies a causal relationship between the governor's tax cut (premise) and the lack of funds for schools (conclusion). This is a GAMMA form (a is X because b is Y) requiring parallel relationships, but the lever is a causal link rather than a parallel comparison. The argument incorrectly assumes causation without establishing a valid parallel relationship, violating the GAMMA constraint. This aligns with False Cause (3) as it misinterprets correlation as causation.",
