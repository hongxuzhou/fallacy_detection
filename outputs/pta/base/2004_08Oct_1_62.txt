Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into its components.

The statement is: "Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush."

So, the conclusion here seems to be that President Bush is responsible for the loss of health care, especially in Missouri. The premises are the statistics about the number of people without health care.

Now, looking at the form. The first part mentions "Five million Americans" and "620,000 Missourians" with no health care. The third part says "96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush." The form here is comparing different groups (Americans vs. Missourians) and linking the loss of health care to President Bush. 

Substance-wise, the statements are about factual data (F) because they are stating numbers and events. The lever here is the connection between the loss of health care and President Bush. The argument is implying that Bush's policies caused the loss, but there's no direct evidence provided. 

Wait, the form here might be Gamma (a is X because b is Y). The conclusion is about the loss under Bush (a is X), and the premise is the number of people without care (b is Y). But the lever here is the causal link between Bush's presidency and the loss. However, the problem is that the lever is not properly established. The argument is making a causal connection without sufficient evidence, which could be a False Cause (3) fallacy. 

Alternatively, looking at the structure, the argument might be using the numbers to create an emotional appeal. The first part mentions a large number of people affected, which could be an appeal to emotion (0), but the main issue is the causal link. The statement doesn't provide evidence that Bush's policies directly caused the loss. So the primary fallacy here is False Cause, as it's assuming causation from correlation without proper justification. 

Wait, but the numbers are presented as facts. The form might be Beta (a is X because b is X), but the comparison isn't clear. The main issue is the causal link between the president's actions and the loss of health care. So, the lever is supposed to be a causal or effect relationship, but there's no evidence provided. Therefore, the fallacy would be False Cause (3) because it's assuming that because the loss occurred during Bush's presidency, he is responsible, without establishing a direct causal connection.
