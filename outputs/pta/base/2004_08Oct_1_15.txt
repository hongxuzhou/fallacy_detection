Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into its components: conclusion, premises, form, substance, and lever.

The statement is: "And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper."

So, the speaker is accusing the president of being a flip-flopper, using the reasons they previously described. The key here is that the speaker is attacking the president's character based on their actions, which might be a form of ad hominem.

Looking at the form, the structure seems to be comparing the president's actions (running around the country) to the label of being wishy-washy. The substance here is probably a value judgment (V) since it's about character. The lever is the connection between the president's actions and the label. 

Wait, the form might be alpha or beta? Let me check. The form is about how subjects and predicates are configured. The conclusion is that the president is a flip-flopper (V), and the premise is that they've been running around using reasons (maybe a fact, F). But the lever here is the implication that the actions (running around) equate to being flip-floppy. 

But the main issue is that the speaker is attacking the president's character (ad hominem) instead of addressing the actual argument. The fallacy here is attacking the person rather than the argument. The classification would be Ad Hominem (2). 

Wait, the statement doesn't directly attack the president's character but rather labels them as wishy-washy based on their actions. That might be a form of name-calling, which is a sub-type of ad hominem. So the primary violation is ad hominem (2). 

I need to make sure there's no other fallacy. The lever here is the connection between the actions (running around) and the label. But the form might be beta, comparing the president's actions to the label. However, the main fallacy is the ad hominem attack, so the classification is 2.
