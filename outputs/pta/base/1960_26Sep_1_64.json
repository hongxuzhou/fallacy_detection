    "analysis": "The statement presents a factual comparison between price increases under two administrations (Truman and Eisenhower). The form is Beta (same predicate, different subjects), and the substance is Fact (F). The lever is a quantitative comparison (five times as much), which is a valid equality lever for Beta. However, the argument lacks a legitimate comparison rationale (e.g., similarity in economic policies or conditions), violating the Beta constraint of requiring a valid analogy or similarity. This creates an unsupported comparison, aligning with the False Cause (3) fallacy due to misinterpreting correlation (administrative periods) as causation (price increases).",
