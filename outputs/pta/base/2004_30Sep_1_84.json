    "analysis": "The argument presents a hypothetical scenario where Saddam Hussein's rule would have led to worse outcomes. The structure implies a causal link between inaction (not allowing inspectors) and Saddam's strength, which then leads to worse global outcomes. However, this causal relationship is not substantiated by evidence, violating the constraint for Alpha form (FF) which requires causal levers. The argument assumes a direct cause-effect without proper justification, fitting the False Cause (3) fallacy.",
