    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('narcotics wrapped up guy', 'murders a police officer') to evoke a visceral reaction, bypassing logical reasoning. The conclusion (policy: 'they ought to pay with their life') is tied to an emotionally loaded premise rather than a valid lever (e.g., legal principle, evidence). This violates the constraint for alpha form (VF) by substituting emotional appeal for a criterion/definition lever, leading to an Appeal to Emotion.",
