    "analysis": "The argument cites numerous experts (Nobel laureates, economists, businesspeople) as support for the speaker's economic ideas. This is a BETA form (a is X because b is X), where the conclusion (a: speaker's ideas are correct) is supported by the premise (b: experts endorse them). The lever is an appeal to authority, which violates the BETA constraint requiring a legitimate comparison (similarity/analogy/equality) between a and b. The argument assumes authority equals validity without establishing relevance or expertise in the specific claim.",
