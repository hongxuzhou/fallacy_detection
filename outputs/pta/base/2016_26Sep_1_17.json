    "analysis": "The statement argues that tax policies caused a housing crisis and then attributes support for the crisis to Donald. The primary structural violation is an ad hominem (classification 2), as it attacks Donald's character or actions (supporting the crisis) rather than addressing the causal link between tax policies and the crisis. The lever connecting Donald to the argument is a personal attack, not a legitimate evaluative or causal connection.",
    "classification": 2
