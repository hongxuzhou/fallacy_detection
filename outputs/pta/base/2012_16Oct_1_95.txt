Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to analyze the given statement using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. The statement is: "And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well."

First, I need to identify the conclusion and premises. The conclusion seems to be that redirecting war spending to rebuild infrastructure will make both individual and America's futures bright. The premises are that we've been spending money on war, and using that money for rebuilding roads, bridges, schools.

Next, determine the form. The structure here is comparing two different uses of money: war spending vs. rebuilding. The subjects here are different (war spending vs. infrastructure), so this might be a Gamma form (a is X because b is Y), where a is the war spending and b is the rebuilding. But wait, the conclusion is about the effect of redirecting money, so maybe it's a Beta form? Or maybe Alpha? Let me think again.

The form is about how the subjects and predicates are configured. The conclusion is about the effect of using money for rebuilding (so the predicate here is "future will be bright"). The premise is about the money spent on war. So the form is comparing two different uses of money (war vs. rebuilding), which might be Beta (a is X because b is X) if they are similar. But the lever here is the comparison between the two uses. The argument is that because we've been spending on war, we should instead spend on rebuilding. But the lever is the similarity in the effect of using money for these purposes. Wait, maybe the lever is that both are expenditures, but the argument is that redirecting funds would have a positive outcome. 

Looking at the substance: the premise is about money spent on war (a fact, F), and the conclusion is about the future being bright (a value, V). So the form is from a fact (F) to a value (V). According to the valid constraint patterns, Alpha (same subject) would require evaluative levers if it's VV or PV. But here, the form is different subjects (war spending vs. rebuilding), so maybe Gamma (a is X because b is Y). Gamma requires parallel relationships, like "a:b as X:Y". The argument is that instead of spending on war (which is a bad use), we should spend on rebuilding (a good use). The lever here is the comparison between the two uses. But the problem is that the argument is not clearly establishing a parallel relationship. It's more of a suggestion that redirecting funds would lead to positive outcomes, but the lever is missing a proper comparison. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a Beta form (a is X because b is X), where a is the rebuilding and b is the war spending. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, Beta requires similarity or analogy between a and b. The argument is saying that if we use the money for rebuilding instead of war, the future will be bright. The lever here is the implication that using money on rebuilding (which is good) would lead to a better future. But the problem is that the argument is making a value judgment (future will be bright) based on the fact that money is being spent on war. The lever here is not clearly established. 

Looking at the substance: the premise is a fact (F), the conclusion is a value (V). So the lever should be evaluative or principled. But the argument doesn't provide a clear evaluative lever. It's more of an appeal to the emotional benefit of rebuilding infrastructure, which might be an appeal to emotion. Wait, but the classification options include Appeal to Emotion (0), Appeal to Authority (1), etc. 

Alternatively, the argument could be a False Cause (3) if it's assuming that because we spent money on war, redirecting it would cause a better future. But the problem is that the connection between the premise and conclusion is not clearly causal. The argument is making a value judgment based on the fact that the money is being spent on war, but the lever is missing. 

Wait, the structure is: because we've been spending money on war (F), we should use that money on rebuilding (V). The lever here is the assumption that using the money on rebuilding will lead to a better future. But the argument doesn't establish a causal link (False Cause) or a similarity (Beta). The main issue is that the argument is shifting from a fact (spending on war) to a value (future will be bright) without a proper lever. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to emotion (0) by using emotionally charged language like "bright future" and "rebuild America," which are emotive terms. The fallacy here is that the argument is using emotional language to persuade rather than logical reasoning. The classification would be Appeal to Emotion (0). 

But I need to check the constraints. The form is Gamma (a is X because b is Y) where a is the money spent on war, and b is the money spent on rebuilding. The lever is the comparison between the two. But the argument isn't establishing a parallel relationship. Instead, it's suggesting that redirecting funds from war to rebuilding will have a positive effect. The lever is missing a proper comparison. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a Slippery Slope (4) if it's implying that not doing this will lead to a negative outcome, but the statement doesn't mention that. 

Alternatively, the argument could be an appeal to authority (1) if it's citing experts, but there's no mention of authorities here. 

So the primary violation is the lack of a proper lever between the premise (fact about war spending) and the conclusion (value about future). The argument is making a value judgment based on a fact without a proper evaluative or principled lever, which could be an appeal to emotion (0) because it's using emotional language to evoke a positive future. 

Therefore, the classification would be 0 (Appeal to Emotion).
