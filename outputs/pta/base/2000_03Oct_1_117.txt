Okay, let's tackle this statement: "A promise made will be a promise kept." Hmm, first I need to break it down according to the PTA framework. 

So, the user wants me to identify the form, substance, lever, and check for fallacies. Let's start by figuring out the conclusion and premises. The statement seems to be a general assertion. Maybe the conclusion is that promises are kept, and the premise is that promises are made? Wait, but it's a single statement. Maybe it's a tautology?

Form-wise, looking at the structure. The subject here is "a promise made" and the predicate is "will be a promise kept." So the form might be alpha (same subject) because both parts refer to the same subject, "a promise." But I need to check the form categories again. Alpha is when the subject is the same. So the form here is alpha.

Substance: The statement is about the nature of promises. Is it a fact, value, or policy? Well, it's making a general claim about promises. It's more of a value judgment or a principle, maybe a policy? Wait, the substance types are Fact (F), Value (V), or Policy (P). The statement isn't stating a fact about the world (like "Promises are kept in 90% of cases"), but rather a normative statement about the nature of promises. So maybe substance is Value (V) or Policy (P)? Or is it a fact? Hmm, maybe it's a value statement because it's about what should be the case. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a policy, but I think it's more of a value or a principle. Let me think again. The statement is a general principle, so perhaps it's a value (V) because it's about what is right or proper. 

Now, the lever. The lever is the connection between non-common elements. In this case, the subject is "a promise made" and the predicate is "will be a promise kept." The lever here is the implication that making a promise leads to keeping it. But the form is alpha (same subject), so the lever should be according to the alpha constraints. For alpha, the valid levers depend on the substances. If the form is alpha, and the substances are VF, then the lever should be criterion/definition. But if both are V, then the lever would be evaluative or principled. 

Wait, the statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." So the premise is that a promise is made, and the conclusion is that it will be kept. But the structure is a bit circular. It's like saying "A is A." So maybe it's a tautology. But how does that fit into the PTA framework? 

Alternatively, maybe the form is alpha (same subject), and the lever is a definition or criterion. But the problem is that the statement doesn't provide a causal or evaluative lever. It's just restating the same thing. So maybe the lever is missing or not properly established. 

Looking at the valid constraint patterns for alpha: if the form is alpha, then for FF, it needs causal/effect levers. For VF, criterion/definition. For VV/PF/PV, evaluative/principled. 

In this case, the statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." The substance of the premise (a promise made) and the conclusion (a promise kept) are both value statements? Or maybe the premise is a fact (a promise is made) and the conclusion is a value (it should be kept)? Wait, the statement is a bit ambiguous. It's not clear whether it's stating a fact or a value. 

Alternatively, maybe the statement is a tautology, which doesn't actually make an argument. If there's no real argument, then perhaps it's not a valid argument and falls under a fallacy. But according to the fallacy list, what would that be? 

Looking at the fallacies, maybe it's an appeal to emotion (0) if it's using emotional language, but the statement doesn't seem to have emotional language. Or maybe it's a false cause (3) if it's implying a causal relationship without justification. Wait, the statement is more of a tautology, which is a logical fallacy. However, the PTA framework might categorize it differently. 

Alternatively, since the lever is missing, maybe it's a fallacy of false cause. Wait, the structure is alpha, and the lever is supposed to connect the premise and conclusion. If there's no proper lever, then it's a fallacy. 

But according to the constraints, for alpha form, if the substances are VF, the lever should be criterion/definition. But here, maybe the lever is not properly established. The statement is just stating that making a promise leads to keeping it, but without a proper lever. 

Alternatively, maybe the statement is a circular argument. But in the PTA framework, circularity might not be a listed fallacy. The fallacies listed are 0-5. The closest might be a false cause (3) if it's assuming causation without evidence. 

Alternatively, the statement could be an appeal to authority (1) if it's implying that promises are kept because of some authority, but that's not the case here. 

Wait, the statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." It's a general principle. But if there's no actual reasoning provided, it's just a restatement. So maybe it's a tautology, which is not a listed fallacy in the given list. However, the PTA framework might consider it a fallacy if the lever is missing. 

Alternatively, maybe the lever is a definition. If the lever is a definition, then it's valid. But if the definition is circular, then it's a fallacy. 

But the problem is that the statement is not making a clear argument. It's more of a statement than an argument. So maybe there's no premise and conclusion, just a single statement. But according to the analysis procedure, I need to identify conclusion and premises. 

Wait, perhaps the conclusion is "a promise will be kept" and the premise is "a promise is made." But that's not a valid argument because the premise doesn't support the conclusion. The form is alpha (same subject), but the lever is missing. 

So, according to the constraints, for alpha form, if the substances are VF (fact and value), the lever should be criterion/definition. But in this case, the substances might both be values. So the lever should be evaluative/principled. But if there's no lever, then it's a fallacy. 

Alternatively, the lever is the definition of a promise. If a promise is defined as something that is kept, then it's a tautology. But that's not a valid argument. 

In the given fallacies, the closest might be a false cause (3) if it's assuming that making a promise causes it to be kept. But that's not exactly the case. 

Alternatively, since the lever is not properly established, it's an appeal to emotion (0) if it's using emotional language, but the statement is neutral. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a false cause because it's implying a direct cause without evidence. 

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The statement is a tautology. Tautologies are not fallacies per se, but in the context of argumentation, they might be considered as not providing any real argument. However, the PTA framework might categorize this as a fallacy if the lever is missing. 

Alternatively, since the lever is not properly established, the classification might be false cause (3) or appeal to emotion (0). 

But according to the PTA constraints, if the lever is missing, then it's a violation. The primary violation would be the lack of a proper lever. Looking at the fallacy list, the closest is false cause (3), which is about misinterpreting correlation for causation. 

Alternatively, if the form is alpha and the lever is not properly established, it's a violation. But the fallacy classification might be false cause. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a fallacy of begging the question, which is a type of circular reasoning. But the given fallacies don't include that. 

Since the options are 0-5, and the statement is a tautology, perhaps it's not a listed fallacy. But according to the PTA framework, the primary violation is the lack of a proper lever. 

Wait, the statement is "A promise made will be a promise kept." The form is alpha (same subject). The substances are both value (V) since it's about the nature of promises. The lever should be evaluative/principled. But the lever is not provided. It's just restating the same thing. So the lever is missing, which is a violation. 

But the fallacy list doesn't have a specific category for this. However, the closest might be false cause (3) if it's assuming causation without evidence. 

Alternatively, if the lever is a definition, then it's valid. But if the definition is circular, then it's a fallacy. 

Hmm. Maybe the classification is 0 (appeal to emotion) if the statement is emotionally loaded, but it's not. 

Alternatively, the classification is 3 (false cause) because it's assuming that making a promise causes it to be kept. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the PTA constraints again. 

For alpha form, if the substances are VF, the lever is criterion/definition. If they are VV, the lever is evaluative/principled. 

In this case, the statement is about promises, so maybe both are values. So the lever should be evaluative. But the lever is not provided. The statement is just a tautology. 

So the primary violation is that the lever is not properly established. But according to the fallacy list, the closest is false cause (3) or maybe appeal to emotion. 

Alternatively, since there's no real argument, it's a non-argument, but the fallacy list doesn't include that. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is that there's no fallacy, but the user's instructions say to focus on the primary structural violation. 

Wait, the user says to focus on the primary structural violation. The statement is a tautology, which might be considered a fallacy of begging the question, but that's not listed. However, the PTA framework's fallacies include false cause (3) and others. 

Alternatively, the lever is not properly established, which could be a false cause (3) if it's assuming a causal relationship without evidence. 

But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is 3 (false cause) or 0 (appeal to emotion). 

Alternatively, since the lever is missing, it's a fallacy of false cause. 

I think the best fit here is false cause (3), but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, it might be a tautology, which isn't listed, so the closest is 3. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a fallacy of false cause because it's implying that making a promise causes it to be kept, which is a causal relationship without evidence. 

So, I'll go with classification 3 (False Cause).
