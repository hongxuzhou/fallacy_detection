    "analysis": "The statement presents a conditional relationship where strength overseas is claimed to depend on strength at home. This structure (A unless B) implies a necessary condition but lacks evidence of a causal or parallel relationship (gamma form requires 'a:b as X:Y'). The lever (necessity of strength at home for strength overseas) is not justified by similarity, analogy, or proportional reasoning, leading to a false causal assumption.",
