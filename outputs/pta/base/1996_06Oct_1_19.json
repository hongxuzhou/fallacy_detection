    "analysis": "The statement shifts responsibility by contrasting the speaker's inaction with the actions of others (Dole and Gingrich), implying their actions are the cause of the issue. This is a tu quoque ad hominem (type 2) fallacy, as it attacks the opponents' actions to deflect from the speaker's own accountability rather than addressing the argument's substance.",
