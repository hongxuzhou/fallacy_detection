    "analysis": "The statement attempts to link 'we dying' to 'he said it's dangerous' through an unsupported causal connection. The form is GAMMA (a is X because b is Y), but the lever fails to establish a parallel relationship. The argument incorrectly assumes that a statement about danger (he said it's dangerous) directly causes a consequence (we're dying), violating the constraint that GAMMA requires proportional or parallel reasoning. This is a classic False Cause fallacy (3) by misinterpreting correlation as causation.",
