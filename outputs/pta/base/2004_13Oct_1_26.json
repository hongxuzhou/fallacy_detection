    "analysis": "The argument cites the CBO's report to claim the president's plan would create a $2 trillion deficit in Social Security. The premise (workers pay into the system for retirees) is used to support the conclusion (plan leads to deficit). This forms a causal relationship (FF lever) but violates Gamma's requirement for parallel relationships (a:b as X:Y). The argument assumes the plan's structure mirrors the current system's structure without establishing a valid parallel, leading to a false causal link.",
