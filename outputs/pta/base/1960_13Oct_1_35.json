    "analysis": "The statement uses the positions of General Ridgway and Secretary Herter as premises to support the speaker's conclusion. The form is BETA (a is X because b is X), where the speaker's stance aligns with the cited authorities. The lever relies on their authority, but the argument lacks a legitimate comparison or causal link. This is an Appeal to Authority (1) as the speaker cites non-expert opinions without evidence, relying solely on their positions.",
