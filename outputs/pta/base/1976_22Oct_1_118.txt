Okay, let's tackle this statement. The user wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments framework. First, I need to break down the statement into its components: conclusion, premises, form, substance, and lever. 

The statement is: "But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, 'I believe our nation is greater than what we are now.'"

Hmm, the conclusion here seems to be the belief that the nation is greater than it is now. The premises are the three entities (president, Congress, people) all saying this. Wait, but the structure is a conditional statement. The "if" part is the premise, and the conclusion is the belief. But maybe the actual conclusion is that the nation is indeed greater because these authorities say so.

Looking at the form: The subjects here are the president, Congress, and people. The predicate is their belief. So the form is BETA (a is X because b is X), since the same predicate (belief) is attributed to different subjects. Wait, no. The form is about how subjects and predicates are configured. The original statement's structure is that three different subjects (president, Congress, people) all have the same predicate (belief that nation is greater). So that's BETA, where a is X because b is X, but here a, b, and c are different subjects. Wait, the BETA form is when a is X because b is X. So maybe the structure here is that the conclusion (nation is greater) is based on the premises that these three groups believe it. But the form would be Gamma? Because the conclusion is about the nation (a) being greater (X) because the three groups (b, c, d) have a belief (Y). Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the form is determined by how subjects and predicates are arranged. The statement is: If the president, Congress, and people say "I believe our nation is greater..." So the conclusion is that the nation is greater (X), and the premise is that these three groups (subjects) believe that (Y). So the form would be BETA if the conclusion is based on the same predicate (belief) from different subjects. Wait, but BETA is when a is X because b is X. So if the conclusion is that the nation is greater (a is X), and the premise is that the president (b) is X (has the belief), then that's BETA. But here, the premise is that three different subjects (president, Congress, people) all have the same belief. So maybe the form is Gamma, which is when a is X because b is Y, but here the conclusion is a is X, and the premises are that three different subjects (b, c, d) have Y (belief). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the PTA forms.

The forms are:

- Alpha: same subject, different predicate
- Beta: same predicate, different subject
- Gamma: different subject and predicate
- Delta: meta-level

In this case, the conclusion is about the nation's greatness (X), and the premise is that three different subjects (president, Congress, people) have a belief (Y). So the form would be Gamma (a is X because b is Y), since the conclusion (a is X) is connected to the premise (b is Y). But the premise here is that multiple different subjects (president, Congress, people) all have the same Y (belief). So the form is Gamma, but the lever would be the connection between the belief of these groups and the nation's greatness. 

Now, substance: The conclusion is a value judgment (V) because it's about the nation being greater. The premises are about beliefs (which are facts if they are stated, but here it's the belief itself, so maybe value? Or is the belief a fact? Wait, the premise is that these groups believe something. The substance of the premise would be Fact (F) if the belief is a fact, but actually, the belief is a statement of their own opinion, so maybe the premise is a value (V) since it's about their belief. Wait, the substance types are Fact (F), Value (V), or Policy (P). The statement "the president says X" is a fact if it's about the president's actions, but here it's about their belief, which is a value judgment. Hmm, maybe the premise is a value (V) because it's about their belief. The conclusion is also a value (V) because it's about the nation being greater. 

So the form is Gamma (a is X because b is Y), and the substances are both V. The lever here would be the connection between the belief (Y) of the groups and the nation's greatness (X). But the lever must be a parallel relationship. Gamma requires that "a:b as X:Y", meaning that the relationship between a and b is similar to the relationship between X and Y. However, in this case, the premise is that the groups have a belief (Y), and the conclusion is that the nation is greater (X). There's no clear parallel relationship. The lever here is the assumption that the belief of the groups (Y) implies the nation is greater (X). This is a fallacy because it's not a valid connection. 

Looking at the fallacy types, this seems like an appeal to authority (1), because the argument is relying on the belief of the president, Congress, and people (which are authorities) to support the conclusion. But the lever here is not a similarity or analogy but rather an appeal to the authority's opinion. However, the PTA constraints for Beta (if it were Beta) require similarity/analogy. Wait, but the form here is Gamma. Wait, the form is Gamma because the conclusion (a is X) is based on the premise that b is Y. But the lever is not a parallel relationship. The lever here is the assumption that the belief of these groups (Y) leads to the conclusion that the nation is greater (X). That's a false cause (3) because it's assuming a causal link between their belief and the actual state of the nation. Alternatively, it could be an appeal to authority (1) if the argument is that because authorities believe it, it's true. 

Wait, the original statement is a conditional: "if the president, Congress, and people said..." So the premise is that these authorities hold the belief, and the conclusion is that the nation is greater. But the argument is not directly stating that the nation is greater, but rather that if these groups say it, then it's true. Wait, the actual statement is a bit unclear. The original statement is a bit of a quote, so maybe the conclusion is that the nation is greater because these groups believe it. So the form is Gamma, and the lever is the connection between the belief and the reality. Since the lever is not a valid parallel relationship, it's a fallacy. 

Looking at the fallacy types, Appeal to Authority (1) is when an authority's opinion is cited without evidence. However, the lever here is not just authority but the belief of the group. Alternatively, it's an appeal to popularity (since it's the people's belief), which could be a form of appeal to authority or appeal to the majority. But in the PTA framework, the classification is based on the constraint violations. 

In the PTA, for Gamma (a is X because b is Y), the lever should be a parallel relationship. Here, the lever is not a parallel relationship but an appeal to the belief of the groups. Therefore, the fallacy is Appeal to Authority (1) because it's relying on the authority of the president, Congress, and people to validate the conclusion. However, the people are not an authority in the same way as the president or Congress. But the statement includes the people, so it's a majority. 

Alternatively, the lever could be a false cause (3) if it's assuming that the belief causes the nation to be greater. But the form is Gamma, which requires parallel relationships. Since there's no parallel, the lever is invalid. Therefore, the primary fallacy is Appeal to Authority (1) because the argument relies on the authority of the three groups. But wait, the people are not an authority, so maybe it's a different fallacy. Alternatively, it's an appeal to popularity (which is a type of appeal to authority, but the classification here is 1 for appeal to authority, 0 for appeal to emotion, etc.). 

Wait, the classification options are 0-5 as per the list. The user's instruction says to check for the primary violation. The main issue here is that the argument is using the opinion of the president, Congress, and people (which are authorities or majority) to support the conclusion, which is a classic appeal to authority. So the classification would be 1 (Appeal to Authority). 

But let me check again. The lever is supposed to be the connection between non-common elements. In Gamma, the lever is the parallel relationship. Here, the conclusion is about the nation's greatness (X), and the premise is about the belief of the groups (Y). The lever is not a parallel, so it's a violation. The correct lever for Gamma would be "a:b as X:Y", but here, the connection is not established. So the lever is invalid, leading to a false cause (3) or appeal to authority (1). 

Alternatively, since the argument is using the authority of the three groups (president, Congress, people) to support the conclusion, it's an appeal to authority. Hence, classification 1.
