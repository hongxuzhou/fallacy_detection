    "analysis": "The statement 'It is time for a change.' is a vague value judgment (V) with no explicit premise or lever. It lacks structural components required for valid argumentation, relying instead on emotive language to provoke agreement. This aligns with the 'Slogans' fallacy (5) as it uses a brief, emotionally charged phrase to bypass logical reasoning.",
    "classification": 5
