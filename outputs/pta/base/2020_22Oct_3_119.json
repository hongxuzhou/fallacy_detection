{
    "analysis": "The statement 'Our character is on the ballot' lacks a clear premise-conclusion structure and fails to establish a valid lever connecting the subject ('our character') to the predicate ('is on the ballot'). It uses emotionally charged language ('character') to evoke a response without providing logical reasoning or evidence, violating the constraints for a Value (V) substance. The emotional appeal dominates the argument, making it a fallacy of emotional manipulation.",
