    "analysis": "The statement cites 500 economists and seven Nobel laureates as authority figures to support the claim that the tax scheme is bad for the economy. This is a Delta-form argument (q because Z) where Z is supposed to be a legitimate acceptability indicator. However, the fallacy lies in using the sheer number of experts (popularity) as the primary support without providing their specific reasoning or evidence. While Nobel laureates are relevant experts, the argument relies on their status alone rather than their actual analysis, violating the requirement that authority must be accompanied by evidence. This is a classic Appeal to Authority (1) fallacy, as the speaker uses the authority of non-experts (or at least, the popularity of experts) without substantiating the claim with their reasoning.",
