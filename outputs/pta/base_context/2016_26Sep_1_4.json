    "analysis": "The statement attacks Donald Trump's personal circumstances (fortune, family background) to dismiss his policy beliefs, which constitutes an Ad Hominem fallacy. It shifts focus from evaluating his policy argument ('helping wealthy people') to undermining his character/personal success. The lever is improperly used to attack the arguer rather than addressing the policy itself. This violates the PTA constraint by substituting personal attacks for logical engagement with the claim.",
