{
    "analysis": "The statement 'A promise made will be a promise kept' is a general principle (value statement) presented as a universal truth. However, it lacks a proper lever to justify its validity. The speaker uses this principle to argue that Social Security promises will be honored, but the lever connecting the premise (promises made) to the conclusion (promises kept) is not substantiated. This violates the Alpha form's requirement for an evaluative or principled lever, as the statement assumes the truth of the principle without evidence. The fallacy here is False Cause (3), as the speaker mistakenly assumes a direct causal link between making a promise and its fulfillment, ignoring the possibility of unmet obligations or external factors.",
