    "analysis": "The statement attacks Paul Tsongas by labeling his opposition to the capital gains cut as the 'dumbest thing' done, which is a personal attack rather than addressing the policy argument. This violates the Ad Hominem constraint by shifting focus to the individual's character (calling his action 'dumbest') instead of engaging with the substance of the policy. The lever here is emotional name-calling, not a legitimate argumentative connection. While emotional language is present, the primary violation is the personal attack, which aligns with Ad Hominem (2).",
