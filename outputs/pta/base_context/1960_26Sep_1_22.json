    "analysis": "The statement argues that President Eisenhower's vetoes are sustained because Congress and the people support him. This is structured as an Alpha-form argument (a is X because a is Y), where the conclusion (sustained vetoes) is a policy (P) and the premise (public support) is a fact (F). The lever is a causal claim that public support leads to sustained vetoes. However, the causal connection is not properly justified, as the argument assumes correlation (public support and sustained vetoes) as causation without evidence. This violates the Alpha constraint for PF (Policy-Fact) by failing to provide an evaluative/principled lever, instead relying on an unproven causal link. The primary structural violation is mistaking correlation for causation, fitting the False Cause (3) fallacy.",
