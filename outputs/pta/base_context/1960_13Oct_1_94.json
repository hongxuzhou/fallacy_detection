    "analysis": "The statement employs a chain of escalating consequences (not defending areas \u2192 dictator's aggression \u2192 World War II) without justifying intermediate steps. This matches the Slippery Slope pattern (A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192disaster) where each leap lacks proper lever support. The lever is an analogy to historical events, but the structure focuses on catastrophic chain prediction rather than a single causal claim. The form is Gamma (parallel relationships), but the lever fails to establish legitimate proportional reasoning between the current policy and historical outcomes.",
