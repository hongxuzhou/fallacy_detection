    "analysis": "The statement attributes the housing crisis to Fannie and Freddie Mae through a causal chain (subprime lending \u2192 housing market collapse). Structurally, this is an Alpha form (same subject, causal lever). However, the argument assumes Fannie and Freddie directly caused the subprime lending crisis without sufficient evidence, conflating correlation with causation. While the structure aligns with Alpha-FF constraints, the lever lacks proper justification for the entire causal chain, violating the requirement for a valid causal/effect relationship. This misinterpretation of correlation as causation constitutes a False Cause fallacy.",
