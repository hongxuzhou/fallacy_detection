    "analysis": "The statement uses Abraham Lincoln's historical stature as a lever to evaluate Bob Dole's policy on affirmative action. This is a Beta-form argument (a is X because b is X) where the lever is an analogy between Lincoln's stance on ownership and stake in the American dream and Dole's position. However, Lincoln's views on affirmative action (a modern policy) are not relevant to his historical context, making the analogy invalid. The argument improperly cites Lincoln as an authority on the policy, violating the 'Appeal to Authority' constraint by using a non-expert (historical figure) as a source of credibility. The lever here is not a legitimate similarity but an emotional appeal to Lincoln's revered status, which also aligns with Appeal to Emotion. However, since the primary violation is the misuse of authority, it is classified as Appeal to Authority (1).",
