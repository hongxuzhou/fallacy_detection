    "analysis": "The statement compares the opponent's interest-rate policy to Truman's era, implying the same outcome (inflation). This is a Beta form (a is X because b is X) using an analogy. However, the comparison lacks legitimate justification\u2014Truman's situation involved political control of the Fed, while the current policy's mechanism is different. The lever (similarity) is not valid, creating a false causal link. This violates Beta constraints by using an unsupported analogy, which aligns with False Cause (3) as it misinterprets correlation (similar policy) as causation (same outcome).",
