    "analysis": "The statement 'we'll never be strong again overseas unless we're strong at home' presents a causal relationship (Alpha form) between economic strength (fact) and overseas strength (policy). The lever is a causal claim, but it fails to establish a valid causal link between the two. The argument assumes economic strength is the sole prerequisite for overseas strength without evidence, violating the constraint that Alpha (Policy-Policy) requires evaluative/principled levers, not unverified causal claims. This misinterpretation of correlation as causation aligns with False Cause (3).",
