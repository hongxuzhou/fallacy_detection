    "analysis": "The statement argues that it is unfair to taxpayers who pay on time to allow uncollected taxes. The form is Alpha (same subject: taxpayer), substance is Value (V), and the lever is the emotional appeal of fairness. However, the lever fails to provide a principled or evaluative justification for the claim. Instead, it relies on evoking emotional responses (e.g., 'unfair') to justify the conclusion, violating the PTA constraint that Value statements require evaluative/principled levers. The emotional language ('very unfair') replaces a logical connection, fitting the Appeal to Emotion (0) fallacy.",
