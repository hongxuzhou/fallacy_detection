Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. The statement in question is: "Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe." The date is 2020-10-22, and the context is from a presidential debate. 

First, I need to break down the components according to the PTA framework. Let's start by identifying the conclusion and premises. The speaker is accusing the opponent (Joe) of being all talk and no action, implying that this is why he hasn't gotten things done. So the conclusion here seems to be that Joe isn't capable of getting things done, and the premise is that he's all talk and no action.

Next, determining the form. The structure here is comparing Joe's actions (all talk, no action) to his ability to get things done. The form seems to be Beta (a is X because b is X), where "Joe" (a) is being judged as not getting things done (X) because he's all talk and no action (b is X). Wait, actually, the structure might be more like an ad hominem. Let me think again. The statement is attacking Joe's character (all talk, no action) rather than addressing the actual policy or factual claims. 

Looking at the substance: the statement is a Value (V) judgment about Joe's character, not a fact or policy. The lever here is the comparison between Joe's character traits and his ability to get things done. But the lever is supposed to connect the non-common elements. In this case, the speaker is using Joe's character (all talk, no action) as a reason to dismiss his ability to get things done. 

Wait, the PTA forms: Alpha is same subject, Beta same predicate, Gamma all different, Delta meta-level. The statement is saying "you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action." So the form here is Beta? Because the conclusion is about Joe getting things done (X), and the premise is about Joe being all talk and no action (Y). But the structure is more like an ad hominem, attacking the person's character instead of the argument. 

Looking at the fallacy classification. The user mentioned that Ad Hominem is when the argument attacks the person instead of the argument. The statement is attacking Joe's character (all talk, no action) to dismiss his ability to get things done. That fits Ad Hominem (type 2). 

Also, checking the PTA constraints: Beta form requires similarity/analogy/equality levers. But here, the lever is an attack on the person's character, not a legitimate comparison. So it's a Beta form violation, but the lever is not a similarity but an attack. So this would be Ad Hominem. 

Looking at the classification priority: Ad Hominem is second priority. The statement is not a slogan, since it has a logical structure. It's attacking the person, so Ad Hominem. 

Also, check for other fallacies. Is there an appeal to emotion? Not really, it's more of a direct attack. Appeal to authority? No. False cause or slippery slope? No. So the primary fallacy is Ad Hominem (2).
