    "analysis": "The statement cites the opinions of General Ridgway and Secretary Herter to support the speaker's position on treaty commitments. This aligns with a Beta-form argument (a is X because b is X) where the speaker's stance (a) is justified by the experts' positions (b). The lever is similarity in their shared stance against military action over the islands. However, the speaker does not provide the experts' reasoning or evidence for their claims, relying solely on their authority. This violates the Delta-form constraint for appeal to authority, as the lever is improperly used without substantiating the experts' credibility or evidence. The argument shifts from a valid Beta-form (if the experts' reasoning were included) to an Appeal to Authority fallacy by citing their authority without justification.",
