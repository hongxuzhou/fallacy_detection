    "analysis": "The statement presents a comparison between current inflation (7%) and historical rates (18%, 13%) to argue that the inflationary threat remains urgent. The form is Beta (a is X because b is X), where the current inflation (a) is deemed urgent (X) due to past inflation (b) being similarly high. The lever is the similarity in inflation rates across time. However, the argument implicitly assumes that the current rate (7%) is still 'high' without establishing a clear threshold or definition for what constitutes 'high' inflation, violating the requirement for evaluative/principled levers in Beta form when substance is Value (V). This creates ambiguity in the lever's validity, as the comparison lacks a principled standard to justify the claim of urgency. Additionally, the mention of the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal and its critics introduces a potential Appeal to Authority (1) by citing Business Week, though this is secondary to the main argument.",
