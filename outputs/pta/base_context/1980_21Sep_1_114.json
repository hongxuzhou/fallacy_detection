    "analysis": "The statement argues that state interference in personal decisions (e.g., abortion) violates the First Amendment. The form is Alpha (same subject: state interference), with substance as Value (individual freedom) and Policy (state action). The lever is the First Amendment, which is cited as a principled authority. However, the First Amendment does not directly address abortion or state interference in medical decisions, making its application improper. This misuse of the Constitution as an authority without valid evidence constitutes an Appeal to Authority (1).",
