    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged descriptions of Willie Horton's crimes (murderer, rape, brutalization) to justify the policy decision not to extradite him. The lever connecting the premise (not wanting furloughs) to the conclusion (not extraditing) relies on evoking fear and moral outrage rather than logical reasoning. This violates the PTA constraint by substituting emotion for a valid causal or evaluative lever, fitting the 'Appeal to Emotion' fallacy. The emotional framing of the argument prioritizes emotional reaction over substantive policy justification.",
