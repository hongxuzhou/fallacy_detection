    "analysis": "The statement attacks the opponent's character ('all talk and no action') rather than addressing the substantive claim about their ability to get things done. This is a classic ad hominem fallacy, where the argument shifts focus from the claim ('getting things done') to the person's perceived traits. The lever here is a personal attack (negative trait) rather than a legitimate evaluative or causal connection. The form is Beta (a is X because b is X), but the lever violates constraints by substituting a character attack for a valid comparison.",
