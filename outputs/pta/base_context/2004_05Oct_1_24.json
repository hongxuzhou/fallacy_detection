    "analysis": "The statement cites George Tenet's testimony as evidence for the existence of a 10-year relationship between Iraq and terrorists. This constitutes an Appeal to Authority (1) because the argument relies on Tenet's position as an authority without providing the actual content of his testimony or evidence to substantiate the claim. The lever (Tenet's authority) is improperly used as a substitute for factual evidence, violating the PTA constraint that Z (authority) must be a relevant expert with supporting evidence.",
