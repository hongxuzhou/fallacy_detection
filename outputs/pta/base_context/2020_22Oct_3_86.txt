Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a statement from a 2020 presidential debate and wants me to analyze it using the Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA) framework to detect fallacies. The statement is: "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous."

First, I need to break down the components according to the PTA structure. The user mentioned three components: FORM, SUBSTANCE, and LEVER. Let's start by identifying the conclusion and premise.

The conclusion here seems to be "We're dying with it," and the premise is "he's never said — he said it's dangerous." Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. The speaker is saying that because the other person (he) never said something (maybe about a policy or issue), and he did say it's dangerous, so we're dying with it. But the structure isn't entirely clear. Maybe there's a typo or missing context. Let me check the context again.

The context before the statement talks about people reaching over to touch their spouse who's gone, implying a loss or grief. The statement then says, "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." The follow-up question is "When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous?" So the speaker is responding to someone's claim about danger, possibly related to a policy or action. The speaker is arguing that because the other person (he) never said something (maybe a specific statement) and did say it's dangerous, so we're dying with it (meaning the situation is dire).

Now, analyzing the form. The structure seems to be: "We're dying with it (conclusion) because he's never said [something] — he said it's dangerous (premise)." The form here might be a mix of Alpha or Beta. Let's see. The conclusion is about "we" (subject) and the premise is about "he" (another subject). So maybe Beta form? Because the conclusion is about "we" and the premise is about "he." But the lever is the connection between the premise and conclusion. The lever here is "he's never said — he said it's dangerous." Wait, the premise is a bit confusing. It seems like the speaker is saying that the other person never made a certain statement but did say it's dangerous. So maybe the premise is that the other person's statements (about danger) are being used to support the conclusion that we are dying with it (i.e., the situation is dangerous and leading to death).

But the structure might be an Alpha form, where the subject is "we" and the predicate is "dying with it," and the premise is about "he" (another subject) saying it's dangerous. However, the lever here is the connection between the premise and the conclusion. The lever is the implication that because he said it's dangerous, we are dying with it. But that's a causal link? Or maybe a false cause?

Looking at the substance: The conclusion is about a state ("we're dying with it") which might be a value judgment (V), but it's phrased as a factual statement. The premise is about the other person's statements, which could be a value (if the danger is a value judgment) or a fact (if the danger is a factual claim). However, the lever here is the connection between the premise (his statements) and the conclusion (we are dying). 

The lever seems to be that the other person's assertion of danger (a value or fact) leads to the conclusion that we are dying. But this is a causal link. If the form is Alpha (a is X because a is Y), then the lever should be a causal or effect. However, the premise is about another person's statements, not the same subject. So maybe Beta form, where the conclusion is about "we" and the premise is about "he," requiring a similarity or analogy. But the connection is not clear. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using the other person's statement (he said it's dangerous) as a premise to argue that we are dying with it. But this seems like a false cause because the premise is about the other person's statement, not about the actual cause of the situation. The speaker is implying that because the other person said it's dangerous, the situation is so bad that we're dying. That's a false cause fallacy (3), mistaking correlation (the other person's statement) for causation (the actual danger leading to death). 

Wait, but the speaker might be using an appeal to authority (1) if they're citing the other person's statement as an authority. However, the other person is the opponent, not an expert. So that's an appeal to authority fallacy. But the user's classification priority says slogans first, then ad hominem, then appeal to authority. However, the statement here seems to be a false cause because the premise is about the other person's statement, not about the actual cause. 

Alternatively, the structure might be an ad hominem (2) if the speaker is attacking the other person's credibility. The statement says "he's never said — he said it's dangerous," which could be a way of undermining the other person's credibility by pointing out inconsistency (never said something but said it's dangerous). But the conclusion is about the situation being dangerous, not about the other person's character. So maybe it's a false cause. 

Wait, the key is the lever. The lever is the connection between the premise (his statements) and the conclusion (we are dying). If the lever is that his statement implies danger, which leads to us dying, that's a causal link. But the premise is not about the actual cause but about the other person's assertion. So it's a false cause because the speaker is attributing the cause (danger leading to death) to the other person's statement, not to the actual situation. 

Alternatively, the speaker might be using an appeal to emotion (0) by implying that the situation is so dangerous (emotionally charged) that we are dying. But the primary lever here seems to be the causal link between the other person's statement and the conclusion. 

Looking at the classification priority, false cause is last, but if it's a single causal claim, it's false cause. The statement is saying that because the other person said it's dangerous, we are dying. That's a single causal claim (A→B), so false cause. 

But wait, the structure might be more complex. The statement is "We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous." The "he's never said" part might be a contradiction. Maybe the speaker is saying that the other person never made a certain statement (maybe about a policy) but did say it's dangerous. So the premise is that the other person's statement of danger is being used to argue that the situation is so dangerous (we are dying). But this is a false cause because the premise is about the other person's assertion, not the actual cause. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using the other person's statement as an authority, which would be appeal to authority. But the other person is the opponent, not an expert. So that's a fallacy. 

But according to the classification priority, if there's a false cause, it's last. However, the statement's structure seems more like a false cause. The speaker is asserting that because the other person said it's dangerous, the situation is so bad that we're dying. That's a direct causal link, which is false cause. 

So the classification would be 3: False Cause. 

Wait, but the user's example in the fallacy detection for false cause says that it's when a is X because a is Y, with failed causal lever. Here, the conclusion is "we're dying with it" (X), and the premise is "he said it's dangerous" (Y). But the subject is different: "we" vs. "he." So maybe the form is Beta (a is X because b is X), which requires similarity or analogy. But the lever here is not a similarity. Instead, the speaker is using the other person's statement as a reason for the conclusion. That might be a false cause because the premise is not about the same subject. 

Alternatively, the form could be Alpha if the subject is "we" and the premise is about "he," but that doesn't fit. So maybe the form is Gamma (a is X because b is Y), which requires parallel relationships. But I'm getting confused here. 

Let me try again. The conclusion is "We're dying with it" (a is X). The premise is "he's never said — he said it's dangerous" (b is Y). The lever is the connection between b's statement (Y) and a's state (X). The lever here is that because he said it's dangerous, we are dying. That's a causal link, but the subjects are different. So this might be a false cause fallacy, where the speaker is attributing the cause (danger leading to death) to the other person's statement, not to the actual cause. 

Therefore, the primary fallacy is False Cause (3). But I need to check if there's another possible fallacy. The statement might also be an appeal to emotion if "dying" is used to evoke fear. But according to the priority, false cause is last, so if it's a single causal claim, it's false cause. 

So the classification would be 3: False Cause.
