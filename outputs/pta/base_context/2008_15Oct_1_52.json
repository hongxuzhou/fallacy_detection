    "analysis": "The statement attributes the economic crisis to 'the policies of the last eight years' and 'Washington's unwillingness to tackle problems,' implying a direct causal relationship. This is an Alpha-form argument (same subject) with a causal lever. However, the fallacy lies in the improper causal link: the statement assumes the policies caused the crisis without establishing a valid causal mechanism or ruling out alternative factors. This aligns with the False Cause (3) fallacy, as it misinterprets correlation (policies and crisis occurring together) as causation, a common tactic in political debates to deflect blame.",
