Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. The statement in question is: "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy." The date is 1996-10-06, and the context is from a debate where the speaker is criticizing a tax scheme.

First, I need to break down the components using the PTA framework. The form here seems to be Delta because the conclusion is about the tax scheme being bad (q), and the premise is citing experts (Z). The substance is Policy (P) since it's about economic policy. The lever here is the authority of the economists and Nobel laureates.

Looking at the Delta form constraints, Z must be a legitimate acceptability indicator. The speaker is using the authority of 500 economists and seven Nobel winners as Z. However, the key point here is whether these authorities are relevant experts in the field. Nobel laureates in economics are indeed experts, so that's a valid authority. But wait, the problem might be that the speaker is just listing the number of experts without providing their specific reasoning or evidence. The fallacy here could be Appeal to Authority if the authority isn't properly cited with their evidence.

But wait, the classification priority rules say that if it's an appeal to authority, that's third priority. However, the statement doesn't just cite an authority; it's using the number of experts as a form of popularity. The user mentioned that in the Appeal to Authority, Z must be a relevant expert with evidence. Here, the speaker is using the quantity of experts (500 economists, seven Nobel winners) to support the claim, but the actual evidence isn't provided. The fallacy here might be that the speaker is using the popularity of the experts (since there are many) rather than their actual expertise or evidence. However, Nobel laureates are experts, so maybe that's a valid authority. But the problem could be that the speaker isn't providing the specific arguments or evidence from these experts, just their names. That's a classic Appeal to Authority fallacy because it's citing the authority without their reasoning. 

Alternatively, if the statement is structured as "q because Z says q," where Z is the experts, then it's a Delta form. But the lever here is the authority, and if the authority is not properly cited with evidence, that's a fallacy. The speaker is using the number of experts to imply that the claim is true, but without their actual arguments, it's an appeal to authority. 

Wait, the user's rules say that Appeal to Authority is a fallacy if the source is not a relevant expert, or if it's popularity as authority. In this case, the speaker is using the number of experts (500 economists, seven Nobel winners) as support. However, even if they are experts, if the speaker doesn't provide their reasoning, it's still an appeal to authority. The key point is that the argument is relying on the authority's status rather than their actual evidence. So this would be an Appeal to Authority (1) because the speaker is using the authority of the experts without providing their specific evidence or reasoning. 

But I need to check if there's another possible fallacy. The statement also mentions "everybody who's looked at it" which might imply that all experts have agreed, which could be a hasty generalization or an appeal to popularity. However, the main structure here is the authority. So the primary fallacy is Appeal to Authority. 

Another angle: the statement could be a False Cause if the speaker is assuming that because experts say it's bad, it's actually bad. But that's more of an appeal to authority than false cause. False cause is when correlation is mistaken for causation, which isn't the case here. 

So the classification here would be Appeal to Authority (1). The lever is the authority of the experts, but the speaker isn't providing their evidence, just citing their names. Therefore, the fallacy is Appeal to Authority.
