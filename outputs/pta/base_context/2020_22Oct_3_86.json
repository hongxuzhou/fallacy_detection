    "analysis": "The statement 'We're dying with it, because he's never said \u2014 he said it's dangerous' presents a causal link (False Cause) between the opponent's assertion of danger and the conclusion that the situation is so dire (we're dying). The lever is the opponent's statement ('it's dangerous'), which is used as a direct cause for the conclusion about societal collapse. This violates the Alpha-FF constraint by mistaking correlation (the opponent's claim) for causation (the actual danger leading to death). The structure assumes the opponent's assertion inherently validates the conclusion, which is a flawed causal relationship.",
