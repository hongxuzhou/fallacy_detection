    "analysis": "The statement presents a causal claim (Alpha form) asserting that US intervention in southern Africa prevented bloodshed. The lever is a causal relationship between policy action (US moving) and factual outcome (preventing bloodshed). However, the substance combination (Policy \u2192 Fact) requires an evaluative/principled lever, not a causal one. The argument assumes causation without evidence, violating the Alpha constraint for PF substances. This aligns with False Cause (3) as it mistakes correlation for causation, attributing the prevention of bloodshed solely to US action without substantiation.",
