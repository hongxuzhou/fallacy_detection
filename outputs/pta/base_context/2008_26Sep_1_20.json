    "analysis": "The statement cites Admiral Mullen's suggestion as evidence that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous. This is an appeal to authority (Fallacy 1) because it relies on Admiral Mullen's status as an expert without providing substantive reasoning or evidence to support the claim that the plan is dangerous. The structure aligns with Delta-form (q because Z), where Z (Admiral Mullen) is presented as a legitimate authority, but the argument fails to establish a proper causal or evaluative link between the authority's opinion and the conclusion. The lever here is improperly used as a substitute for logical justification.",
