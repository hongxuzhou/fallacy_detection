    "analysis": "The statement attributes a claim to Bernie Sanders about Hillary Clinton's judgment but uses this as a basis to attack Sanders' character (judgment) rather than engaging with the substance of his argument. This aligns with Ad Hominem (2), as the speaker shifts focus from the claim itself to the person's character, implying Sanders' judgment is flawed due to his criticism of Clinton. The lever here is a non-sequitur, as the premise (Sanders' statement about Clinton) does not logically support the conclusion (Sanders' judgment).",
