    "analysis": "The statement uses an emotional appeal (fear of injury) to evoke sympathy for a specific case, bypassing logical connection to the broader argument about health insurance. The form is Alpha (same subject: the father), substance is Fact (F), but the lever is emotional (fear) rather than causal or evaluative. This violates the Alpha FF constraint requiring causal/effect levers, substituting emotion as the primary argumentative tool.",
