    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('minds and hearts and souls of men') to justify the need for ideological efforts, replacing a proper evaluative lever with emotional appeal. The structure is an alpha-form argument (conclusion: dissatisfaction with current Cold War approach; premise: need for ideological offensive), but the lever is emotion rather than a principled or evaluative justification. This violates the alpha-form constraint for value-based arguments, which require evaluative or principled levers. The emotional language serves as the primary connection, making this an appeal to emotion.",
