    "analysis": "The statement uses Senator D'Amato's assertion as a premise to argue against the feasibility of the tax scheme. The form is Beta (a is X because b is X), where the conclusion (tax scheme not possible) is linked to D'Amato's statement (b is Y). The lever here is an appeal to authority, as D'Amato is cited as a credible source, but he is not a relevant expert on Medicare or tax policy. This violates the PTA constraint that authority (Z) must be a relevant expert with evidence. The argument improperly elevates D'Amato's statement as a substitute for logical reasoning, fitting the 'Appeal to Authority' fallacy (1).",
