    "analysis": "The statement 'It's a racist place' is a value judgment (V) with no explicit premise or lever. It lacks a logical structure (no form/substance/lever alignment) and relies on emotional language ('hate,' 'horrible') to evoke a reaction. The lever is improperly substituted with emotional appeal rather than evaluative/principled reasoning, violating PTA constraints for Value (V) statements. The context frames it as a conclusion without supporting evidence, making it an emotional appeal.",
