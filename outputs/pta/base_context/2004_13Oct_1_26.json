    "analysis": "The statement cites the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as a source to argue that adopting the president's plan would create a $2 trillion deficit. This follows a Delta-form argument (q because Z), where Z is the CBO, a legitimate expert authority. The lever is the CBO's credibility as an impartial, bipartisan entity. While the speaker later questions the president's plan by highlighting the deficit, the core argument relies on the CBO's authority, which is a valid use of evidence. There is no structural violation of PTA constraints here, as the lever (CBO's authority) is appropriately applied. However, the broader context may imply a **False Cause** (3) if the speaker assumes the CBO's report directly proves the plan's failure without addressing counterarguments or alternative explanations.",
