    "analysis": "The statement uses an analogy comparing healthcare to the 'buggy and horse days' to evoke an emotional response about outdatedness. This is a Beta form (a is X because b is X) where the lever is a similarity/analogy. However, the comparison is not a legitimate analogy but relies on emotional appeal to highlight backwardness, violating the Beta constraint by substituting emotional reaction for a valid comparison. The emotional state (feeling of backwardness) replaces the proper lever, fitting the 'Appeal to Emotion' fallacy pattern.",
