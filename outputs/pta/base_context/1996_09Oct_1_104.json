    "analysis": "The statement labels urban economies as 'socialist' without evidence, using emotionally charged language to imply moral inferiority. This is a **Name-calling** sub-type of Ad Hominem (2), as it attacks the character of the urban economy rather than addressing its policies. The lever relies on derogatory labeling ('socialist') rather than logical comparison or evidence, violating Beta-form constraints by substituting emotional judgment for legitimate analogy.",
