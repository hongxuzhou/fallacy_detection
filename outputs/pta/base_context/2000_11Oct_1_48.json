    "analysis": "The statement 'There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child' is a value judgment (V) asserting that lack of education is the most prejudiced act. Structurally, it fits an Alpha form (same subject) where the conclusion (prejudiced) is drawn about the subject (not educating a child). The lever here is implied to be evaluative (e.g., education as a civil right), but the statement lacks explicit reasoning or criteria to justify the claim. While the context suggests a principled lever (civil rights), the absence of a clear, stated connection between the subject and predicate violates the PTA constraint for Alpha VF, which requires evaluative/principled levers. The argument relies on emotional weight ('prejudiced') to evoke a moral response, which aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the lever is emotionally charged rather than logically grounded.",
