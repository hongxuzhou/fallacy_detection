    "analysis": "The statement presents a factual claim about Chicago's homicide rate under Obama. While the substance is a Fact (F), the lever used to connect this fact to the argument for stop-and-frisk is emotional (evoking fear of violence). The PTA framework identifies this as an Appeal to Emotion (0), where the emotional impact of the statistic (fear of high crime) is used as the primary lever, bypassing a proper causal or evaluative connection to the policy recommendation. The structure violates the Alpha form by substituting emotion for a valid causal or principled lever.",
