    "analysis": "The statement uses the speaker's personal optimism (emotional state) as the primary lever to justify a claim about societal progress. This violates the PTA constraint for Alpha-form Value-Value (VV) arguments, which require evaluative/principled levers, not emotional states. The speaker's optimism is presented as a justification for progress, conflating personal belief with objective assessment. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the lever is an emotional state (optimism) rather than a valid evaluative or principled reasoning.",
