    "analysis": "The statement shifts blame to Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich by accusing them of specific actions (letting polluters influence laws, opposing tobacco regulations) without providing evidence. This constitutes an **Ad Hominem** (2) fallacy, as it attacks the opponents' character or actions (implying corruption or negligence) rather than addressing the actual policy claims. The structure aligns with inverse Gamma (attacking the arguer's actions rather than the argument itself), and the speaker avoids substantiating their claims, focusing instead on discrediting the opponents. The primary violation is attacking the person (Dole/Gingrich) rather than engaging with the policy substance.",
