    "analysis": "The statement 'They were with the drug companies.' employs a Beta (a is X because b is X) form, where the opposing side (a) is compared to drug companies (b) through the lever of 'being with' a group. However, the comparison is invalid as it equates a political entity (opposing side) with a corporate entity (drug companies) without establishing legitimate similarity or analogy. This flawed analogy attacks the opposing side's alignment with a negative entity (drug companies), shifting focus from the argument to their association, which aligns with Ad Hominem (2) by association. The lever fails to justify the comparison, violating Beta constraints.",
