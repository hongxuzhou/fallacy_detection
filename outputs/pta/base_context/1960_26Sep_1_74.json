    "analysis": "The statement attempts to assert that the committee's formation caused price stability ('since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well'). This is an Alpha-form (same subject) with a Fact (F) substance. The lever is a causal claim (committee formation \u2192 price stability), but no evidence or logical connection is provided to justify this causal relationship. The speaker shifts from acknowledging the committee's lack of legislative output to implying causation without substantiation, violating the requirement for a valid causal lever in Alpha-FF arguments. This is a classic False Cause fallacy, where correlation (committee formation and price stability) is mistaken for causation.",
