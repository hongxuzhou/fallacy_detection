    "analysis": "The statement uses emotional appeal ('in their guts know') to substitute for logical reasoning. The lever is the collective emotional intuition of Americans, not a valid causal or evaluative link. This replaces the proper lever required for a value-based argument (V), violating the PTA constraint by using emotion as the primary justification rather than a principled or evaluative basis. The structure aligns with Beta-form (a is X because b is X) but lacks legitimate comparison, instead relying on emotional consensus as a pseudo-argument.",
