    "analysis": "The statement uses a personal anecdote about racial profiling to evoke emotional responses (anger, frustration, rage) and implies that such incidents are unacceptable. The lever here is emotional appeal rather than logical reasoning. The structure follows a Beta form (a is X because b is X), where the friend's experience (a) is used to argue against racial profiling (X), but the emotional reaction (lever) replaces proper logical justification. The speaker shifts focus from the factual claim to the emotional impact, violating the PTA constraint by using emotion as the primary lever.",
