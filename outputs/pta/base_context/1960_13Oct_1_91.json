    "analysis": "The statement argues that granting power to unions and management will lead to government intervention (wage and price controls), implying a direct causal relationship. This violates the False Cause (3) constraint by asserting a causal link without establishing a valid lever. The speaker assumes that giving power to the two parties will inevitably result in government action, ignoring alternative explanations or evidence. The structure resembles an Alpha-form (a is X because a is Y) with an unproven causal lever, making the argument fallacious.",
