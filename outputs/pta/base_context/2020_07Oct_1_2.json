    "analysis": "The statement reports a factual claim (substance F) about a person's rhetoric. However, the emotionally charged language ('rapists and criminals') is used to evoke a negative emotional reaction, which serves as a lever to attack the person's character. This aligns with the Ad Hominem fallacy (2), where the argument shifts focus from the claim to the claimant's character. The emotional language functions as a lever to delegitimize the person's actions without addressing the substance of their policies or actions directly.",
