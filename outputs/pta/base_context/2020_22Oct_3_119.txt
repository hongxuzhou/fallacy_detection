Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The statement in question is "Our character is on the ballot." The date is 2020-10-22, so this is from a presidential debate, probably between Trump and Biden. The context mentions talking about reputations for honor and telling the truth, and then the statement "Look at us closely." 

First, I need to break down the components according to the PTA framework. Let's start by identifying the form, substance, and lever. The statement is "Our character is on the ballot." The conclusion here seems to be that character is important, and the premise is that it's on the ballot. Wait, but the statement itself is a bit ambiguous. Is the speaker arguing that character is the main factor because it's on the ballot, or is it saying that the ballot includes character?

Looking at the form, the structure is likely Alpha (a is X because a is Y). The subject here is "our character," and the predicate is "is on the ballot." Wait, maybe it's more about the argument that the candidate's character is what's being judged, hence the ballot. But how does that fit into the forms?

Alternatively, maybe the form is Beta, where "our character" is being compared to something else. But the context mentions "you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth." So the speaker is emphasizing that character is a key aspect, and the statement "Our character is on the ballot" is a way of saying that voters are judging based on character.

Now, substance: The statement is about the value of character (V) because it's a key factor in the election. So substance is Value (V). The lever here would be the connection between character and the ballot. But what's the lever? The speaker is implying that because the ballot is about character (or that character is part of the ballot), but maybe the lever is that the ballot is a reflection of character. However, the structure here might be Alpha, where "our character is on the ballot" (a is X) because "we have reputations for honor and truth" (a is Y). Wait, maybe the form is Alpha (a is X because a is Y), where X is "on the ballot" and Y is "reputations for honor and truth."

But the lever here would need to be a valid connection. The problem is that the speaker is using the idea that character (reputation) is what's being evaluated, hence the ballot. However, the lever here might be an appeal to authority or an appeal to emotion. Wait, the lever is supposed to be the connecting relationship between non-common elements. In this case, the non-common elements are the character and the ballot. But how are they connected?

Alternatively, maybe the form is Beta, where "our character is on the ballot" because "others' character is on the ballot" (comparing to others). But the context doesn't mention others' character explicitly. 

Wait, the speaker is saying that voters know their character and the opponent's, so the ballot is about that. The statement "Our character is on the ballot" is a way of saying that character is a key factor. But the lever here might be an appeal to authority or an appeal to emotion. 

Looking at the fallacy classification, if the argument is attacking the opponent's character (which is what the context is doing), but the statement itself is more about the importance of character. However, the speaker is emphasizing their own character and the opponent's, which could be an ad hominem if they are attacking the opponent's character. Wait, the statement itself isn't attacking the opponent's character directly but is stating that character is on the ballot. 

But the context includes the speaker saying "you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth." Then the statement is "Look at us closely." So the speaker is arguing that the voters should look at their character because it's on the ballot. 

Wait, maybe the argument is that the ballot is about character (so the lever is that character is the main factor), but the form is Alpha: "Our character is on the ballot because we have reputations for honor and truth." But the lever here would be the connection between having a good reputation (Y) and the ballot (X). However, the lever needs to be a valid connection. If the speaker is saying that because they have good character (Y), the ballot (X) is about that, but that's a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the form is Beta, comparing their character to others. But the main issue here might be that the speaker is using the concept of character as a lever, but if the lever is not properly established, it could be an appeal to emotion. 

Wait, the statement "Our character is on the ballot" could be an appeal to emotion by implying that voters should care about character, which is a value (V). But the lever here is the connection between character and the ballot. If the lever is not properly justified, maybe it's an appeal to emotion. 

Alternatively, if the speaker is using their own character as an authority (appeal to authority), but the speaker isn't citing an expert, just their own reputation. 

Looking at the classification priority rules: first check if it's a slogan. The statement isn't a slogan, it's a statement. Then check for ad hominem. The speaker is talking about their own character and the opponent's, but the statement itself isn't attacking the opponent. It's more about the importance of character. However, the context includes the speaker talking about the opponent's character, which could be ad hominem if they are attacking the opponent's character. But the statement in question is "Our character is on the ballot," which is more about the ballot being about character rather than attacking. 

Wait, the speaker is saying that voters know their character and the opponent's, so the ballot is about that. The lever here is that character is the main factor. But if the speaker is using the idea that character is on the ballot as a way to shift the focus to their own character, maybe it's an appeal to emotion, using the emotional weight of character (honor, truth) as the lever. 

Alternatively, the form could be Alpha where "Our character is on the ballot" (a is X) because "we have reputations for honor and truth" (a is Y). The lever here would be the connection between reputation and the ballot. But if the lever is not a valid causal or evaluative connection, it could be a false cause or appeal to emotion. 

But the primary fallacy here might be appeal to emotion, as the speaker is using emotional terms like "honor and telling the truth" to evoke a response, rather than a logical connection. The lever is the emotional appeal to the value of character. 

Alternatively, if the speaker is using the ballot as a proxy for character, but that's not a valid lever. 

Wait, the classification rules say that Appeal to Emotion is when emotion replaces the proper lever. So if the lever is supposed to be a causal or evaluative connection but is replaced by emotion, then it's an appeal to emotion. 

In this case, the speaker is emphasizing character (a value) and using emotional terms like "honor and truth" to make the argument that character is on the ballot. The lever here is the emotional appeal to the importance of character, which might not be a proper lever. 

Therefore, the fallacy here would be Appeal to Emotion (0), because the emotional aspect of character (honor, truth) is being used as the lever instead of a proper logical connection. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an appeal to authority if the speaker is implying that their character is an authority, but the speaker is not citing an expert, just their own reputation. 

But according to the classification priority, if it's not a slogan, then check for ad hominem. The statement isn't attacking the person but is about the ballot. So maybe it's an appeal to emotion. 

Another angle: the statement "Our character is on the ballot" could be a form of ad hominem if the speaker is implying that the opponent's character is the main issue, thus attacking the opponent's character. But the statement itself is more about the ballot being about character, not attacking the opponent. 

But the context includes the speaker talking about the opponent's character, so maybe the overall argument is using character as a lever to attack the opponent. However, the specific statement in question is "Our character is on the ballot," which is a general statement. 

In conclusion, the primary fallacy here is likely Appeal to Emotion (0) because the speaker is using emotional terms related to character (honor, truth) as the lever to justify the importance of character on the ballot, rather than a logical or causal connection.
