Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The statement in question is from a 2016 debate, and I need to use the Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA) framework to detect fallacies. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the conclusion and premises. The statement seems to argue against stop-and-frisk policies, but the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. The speaker mentions 3,000 shootings and 4,000 deaths in Chicago during Obama's presidency, then says that people shouldn't be allowed to do that, implying that stop-and-frisk is necessary. Wait, actually, the statement is a bit jumbled. Let me parse it again.

The statement is: "These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk."

Hmm, the structure here is a bit unclear. The speaker starts by calling people "bad people" and then brings up statistics about shootings and deaths in Chicago during Obama's time, then concludes that stop-and-frisk is necessary. Wait, maybe the speaker is arguing that because there are so many shootings, stop-and-frisk is needed. But the way it's phrased is confusing. Let me check the context again. The context mentions that the speaker is talking about law and order in inner cities, targeting African-American and Hispanic communities, and criticizes the opponent for painting a negative picture of these communities.

So the main argument seems to be that because there are high rates of gun violence in Chicago (Obama's hometown), stop-and-frisk is necessary. But the statement starts with "These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—" which might be a fragment. Maybe the speaker is arguing that the people involved in the violence are bad, hence the need for stop-and-frisk. Alternatively, the speaker might be using the high crime stats to justify stop-and-frisk as a solution.

Now, applying the PTA framework. Let's identify form, substance, and lever.

Form: The structure of the argument. The speaker is using statistics (number of shootings and deaths) to argue for stop-and-frisk. The form seems to be a causal relationship (alpha form: a is X because a is Y). The premise is the high number of shootings (Y), and the conclusion is that stop-and-frisk is necessary (X). So, alpha form: "Because there are many shootings (Y), we need stop-and-frisk (X)."

Substance: The premise is a fact (F) about crime rates, and the conclusion is a policy (P) recommendation. So the form is alpha, substance is F leading to P.

Lever: The connection between the premise (fact) and the conclusion (policy) would be a causal lever. The speaker is implying that high crime rates cause the need for stop-and-frisk. However, is there a direct causal link? The lever here is the assumption that high crime necessitates stop-and-frisk. But is that a valid causal relationship? Or is it a false cause fallacy?

Wait, the PTA says that for alpha form (a is X because a is Y), if substance is FF, then the lever must be causal/effect. Here, the substance is F (fact) leading to P (policy). Wait, the substance for the premise is F (fact), and the conclusion is P (policy). So the lever would be a causal or evaluative lever. But the lever here is the argument that high crime rates require stop-and-frisk. The lever is the causal relationship between crime and the need for stop-and-frisk. However, the speaker might be assuming that high crime is caused by certain factors that stop-and-frisk addresses, but is that a valid causal link? Or is it a false cause, assuming that the correlation between crime and stop-and-frisk is causal?

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the statistics to argue that because there's so much crime, stop-and-frisk is necessary. But the lever here is the causal link between high crime and the need for stop-and-frisk. However, the problem could be that the speaker is not providing evidence that stop-and-frisk actually reduces crime, but is instead using the presence of crime as a reason to implement a policy. That could be a false cause fallacy, where the speaker assumes that because crime exists, stop-and-frisk is the solution, without establishing that stop-and-frisk is effective.

Wait, the PTA's False Cause (3) is when there's a misinterpretation of correlation as causation. Here, the speaker is not necessarily saying that stop-and-frisk causes the crime, but rather that the crime (which is a fact) necessitates stop-and-frisk as a policy. But is that a false cause? Or is it a different fallacy?

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the statistics to create an emotional appeal. The numbers are high, which could be an appeal to emotion (0), but the question is whether the lever is emotional. The statement starts with "These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—" which might be an emotional appeal, labeling the people as bad, which could be an ad hominem (2) or appeal to emotion.

Wait, the statement includes "bad people" which is a label. That could be name-calling, which is a type of ad hominem. But the main argument is about the need for stop-and-frisk based on crime stats. Let me check the classification priority rules. If there's a slogan, that's first. But this seems like a real argument. Then, check for ad hominem. The speaker is calling the people involved in the violence "bad people," which is a label. However, the main argument is about the policy. But the structure of the argument is using the fact of high crime to argue for stop-and-frisk. The lever here is the causal link between high crime and the need for stop-and-frisk. However, if the speaker is not providing evidence that stop-and-frisk is effective, that could be a false cause. But the speaker is not making a causal claim between stop-and-frisk and crime reduction; they are saying that because crime exists, stop-and-frisk is necessary. That's more of a policy recommendation based on the existence of a problem, which might not be a fallacy unless there's an unwarranted assumption.

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the high number of shootings to create an emotional appeal, making the audience feel fear or anger, which would be an appeal to emotion (0). But the key is whether the lever is emotional. The statement mentions the numbers, which could be factual, but the phrase "bad people" is emotional. However, the main lever is the causal link between crime and stop-and-frisk. If the lever is not properly established, that could be a false cause.

Wait, the PTA says for alpha form (a is X because a is Y), the lever must be causal/effect if substance is FF. Here, the premise is a fact (F: high crime) and the conclusion is a policy (P: need for stop-and-frisk). The lever here is the causal relationship between high crime and the need for stop-and-frisk. But the speaker is not providing evidence that stop-and-frisk is the solution; they are just stating that because crime exists, stop-and-frisk is needed. That's a policy recommendation based on the presence of a problem, which might not be a fallacy unless the speaker is assuming that stop-and-frisk is the only or best solution without evidence. But in the absence of evidence, that could be a false cause, assuming that the existence of a problem (crime) necessitates a specific solution (stop-and-frisk) without showing that the solution is effective.

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the statistics to create an emotional appeal, making the audience feel that the situation is dire, hence supporting stop-and-frisk. That would be an appeal to emotion (0), where the emotional state (fear, anger) is used as the lever instead of a valid causal link.

But according to the PTA, appeal to emotion is when emotion replaces the proper lever. So if the speaker is using the emotional impact of the numbers (high crime) to argue for stop-and-frisk, that could be an appeal to emotion. However, the numbers are factual, so the lever is the causal link. Wait, the lever is the connection between the premise (high crime) and the conclusion (stop-and-frisk). If the speaker is not providing a valid causal link (e.g., that stop-and-frisk reduces crime), then the lever is missing, which could be a false cause (3). But the speaker is not necessarily saying that stop-and-frisk causes a reduction in crime; they're saying that because there's crime, stop-and-frisk is needed. That's a policy recommendation based on the problem's existence, which is not inherently a fallacy unless the speaker is making a causal claim that isn't supported.

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the high crime stats to argue that the policy is necessary, but the lever is the assumption that the policy is the solution. That's more of a false cause, as the speaker is implying that the existence of crime (Y) necessitates the policy (X), which could be a misinterpretation of correlation as causation. However, the structure here is more about policy based on a problem, not necessarily a causal link between the policy and the problem's resolution.

Another angle: the statement starts with "These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—" which could be an ad hominem, attacking the people involved in the crime as "bad," which is a label. But the main argument is about the policy. However, the speaker is using the fact that there are many shootings to argue for stop-and-frisk. The emotional appeal here could be the use of fear (high crime leading to fear) to justify the policy. So, the lever is fear (emotional) instead of a valid causal link. That would be an appeal to emotion (0).

But I need to check the PTA's definition of appeal to emotion. It says that emotion replaces the proper lever. So if the speaker is using the emotional impact of the numbers (fear of crime) to argue for stop-and-frisk, that's an appeal to emotion. However, the numbers are factual, so the lever should be causal. But if the speaker is not providing a causal link (e.g., that stop-and-frisk reduces crime), then the lever is missing, leading to a false cause. But the speaker isn't making a causal claim between stop-and-frisk and crime reduction; they're just saying that because crime exists, stop-and-frisk is needed. That's more of a policy recommendation based on the problem's existence, which might not be a fallacy unless the speaker is assuming that stop-and-frisk is the only solution.

Alternatively, the statement's structure might be a false cause. The speaker is correlating the high crime (Y) with the need for stop-and-frisk (X), but not establishing that stop-and-frisk is the cause of reducing crime. However, the speaker is not claiming that stop-and-frisk causes a reduction in crime; they're saying that because there's crime, stop-and-frisk is needed. That's a different structure. 

Wait, the PTA's false cause is when correlation is mistaken for causation. If the speaker is saying that because there's high crime, stop-and-frisk is necessary, that's not necessarily a false cause. It's more like a policy recommendation based on the presence of a problem. Unless the speaker is implying that the policy is the cause of the problem, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the high crime stats to create an emotional appeal, which would be an appeal to emotion (0). The numbers are presented to evoke fear, leading to the conclusion that stop-and-frisk is needed. So the lever is fear, not a causal link. That would be an appeal to emotion.

But the statement also includes "bad people," which is name-calling. That could be an ad hominem (2) if the speaker is attacking the people involved in the crime as bad, thereby dismissing their arguments. However, in this context, the speaker is using the label "bad people" to justify the need for stop-and-frisk, which is more of an emotional appeal than an ad hominem attack on the opponent's character.

Considering the classification priority rules, if there's an appeal to emotion, that's fourth priority, but ad hominem is second. However, in this case, the main argument is about the policy based on crime stats, with some emotional language. The primary lever seems to be the emotional impact of the crime stats, leading to the policy recommendation. So the fallacy would be appeal to emotion (0).

Alternatively, the speaker is using the high crime stats to argue for stop-and-frisk, which is a causal link. But without evidence that stop-and-frisk is effective, it's a false cause. However, the speaker isn't claiming that stop-and-frisk causes a reduction in crime, just that it's needed because of the crime. That's more of a policy recommendation based on the problem's existence, which isn't inherently a fallacy.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me re-express the argument structure:

Premise: There are 3,000 shootings and 4,000 deaths in Chicago during Obama's presidency (F: fact).
Conclusion: Therefore, we need stop-and-frisk (P: policy).

The lever is the causal relationship between the high crime and the need for stop-and-frisk. However, the speaker is not providing evidence that stop-and-frisk is effective. This could be a false cause (3), assuming that the existence of a problem (crime) necessitates a specific solution (stop-and-frisk) without showing that the solution is effective. But the structure here is more about policy based on a problem, which might not be a fallacy unless the speaker is making an unwarranted causal claim.

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the emotional impact of the crime stats (fear, anger) to justify the policy, which would be an appeal to emotion (0).

Given the PTA's definitions, if the lever is emotion replacing the proper causal link, then it's an appeal to emotion. However, if the speaker is using the stats to argue for a policy without a valid causal link, that's false cause.

But in this case, the speaker is not making a causal claim between stop-and-frisk and crime reduction. They are saying that because there's crime, stop-and-frisk is needed. That's a different structure. The lever here is the need for policy based on the problem's existence, which is a valid argument unless there's an unwarranted assumption. However, the PTA's false cause is about mistaking correlation for causation. Here, the speaker isn't claiming that stop-and-frisk causes a reduction in crime; they're saying that because there's crime, stop-and-frisk is needed. So that's not a false cause.

Therefore, the main fallacy might be an appeal to emotion (0), where the emotional impact of the crime stats is used to justify the policy. The numbers are presented to evoke fear, leading to the conclusion that stop-and-frisk is necessary. The lever here is the emotional response to the crime stats, not a valid causal link.

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the label "bad people" as name-calling, which is ad hominem (2). But the statement starts with "These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—" which could be attacking the people involved in the crime, implying that they are bad, hence the need for stop-and-frisk. That could be a form of ad hominem by labeling them as bad, which is a type of name-calling.

But the main argument is about the policy based on crime stats. The label "bad people" might be an emotional appeal, not an ad hominem against the opponent. However, if the speaker is using the label to dismiss the people's arguments or to justify the policy, that could be an ad hominem.

Given the classification priority rules, if there's an ad hominem, it's second priority. The statement includes the label "bad people," which is name-calling, which is a type of ad hominem (2). So the primary fallacy here would be ad hominem (2), as the speaker is attacking the people involved in the crime as bad, which is a label, thereby justifying the need for stop-and-frisk.

But wait, the ad hominem is when the argument attacks the person instead of the argument. In this case, the speaker is not attacking the opponent but the people involved in the crime. So maybe it's not ad hominem against the opponent but rather name-calling. However, the PTA's ad hominem includes name-calling as a sub-type. So if the speaker is calling the people involved in the crime "bad people," that's name-calling, which is a form of ad hominem (2).

Therefore, the primary fallacy here is ad hominem (2), as the speaker is using name-calling to justify the policy, which is an attack on the people involved in the crime rather than addressing the policy itself. However, the main argument is about the policy based on crime stats, which might be a separate issue. The label "bad people" could be an emotional appeal, but according to the PTA's ad hominem, name-calling is a sub-type.

Alternatively, the statement's structure is a false cause (3), because the speaker is assuming that the existence of high crime necessitates stop-and-frisk without showing that it's effective. But that's more of a policy recommendation based on the problem's existence, which is not inherently a fallacy.

Given the ambiguity, I need to check the PTA's definitions again. False Cause (3) is when there's a misinterpretation of correlation as causation. Here, the speaker is not making a causal claim between the policy and the crime's reduction, but rather that the existence of crime necessitates the policy. That's not a false cause. The appeal to emotion would be if the emotional impact is used as the lever instead of a valid causal link. The label "bad people" is name-calling, which is ad hominem.

So, the primary fallacy is ad hominem (2), as the speaker is using name-calling to justify the policy, which is an attack on the people involved in the crime rather than addressing the policy's merits. However, the main argument is about the policy, so the label might be an emotional appeal (0) rather than an ad hominem. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it again.

The statement is: "These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk."

The speaker is using the high crime stats (F) to argue for stop-and-frisk (P). The lever here is the causal link between the crime and the need for stop-and-frisk. However, the speaker is not providing evidence that stop-and-frisk is effective. This could be a false cause (3), assuming that the existence of crime necessitates the policy without evidence. Alternatively, the emotional impact of the stats (fear) is used as the lever, making it an appeal to emotion (0).

But the statement also includes "bad people," which is name-calling. That could be an ad hominem (2) if the speaker is attacking the people's character to justify the policy. However, the ad hominem is typically an attack on the opponent's character, not the people involved in the crime. In this context, the speaker is not attacking the opponent but the people in the crime statistics. So it's more of an emotional appeal or name-calling, which is a type of ad hominem.

Given the classification priority rules, if there's an ad hominem, it's second priority. So if the speaker is using name-calling (ad hominem) to justify the policy, that would be the primary fallacy. However, the main argument is based on the crime stats. The label "bad people" might be an emotional appeal (0), but if it's used as a lever, then it's appeal to emotion.

But the structure of the argument is using the stats to argue for the policy, with the label "bad people" possibly as an emotional appeal. The primary lever is the emotional impact of the stats, leading to the policy recommendation. So the fallacy would be appeal to emotion (0).

But I'm still torn between ad hominem and appeal to emotion. The key is whether the lever is emotional or the attack on the people. Since the speaker is not attacking the opponent but the people in the crime stats, it's more of an emotional appeal. Therefore, the primary fallacy is appeal to emotion (0).
