    "analysis": "The statement presents a causal relationship (Alpha form) between tax cuts to the wealthy and reduced school funding. However, it assumes a direct cause-effect link without establishing that the tax cuts necessarily caused the lack of funds. The lever (causal relationship) is improperly justified, as the argument conflates allocation of funds with budgetary outcomes without addressing other potential factors. This violates the Alpha-FF constraint requiring valid causal/effect levers, constituting a False Cause fallacy.",
