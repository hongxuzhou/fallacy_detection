    "analysis": "The statement asserts that the party platform's specification of 'respecting the sanctity of human life' is the criterion for judicial appointments. This uses the party platform as the primary lever to justify the judges' qualifications. However, the party platform is a policy document, not a relevant expert or authoritative source in the field of judicial qualifications. This violates the PTA constraint for Delta-form arguments, where Z (the authority) must be a legitimate expert with evidence. By treating the party platform as an authority, the speaker commits an Appeal to Authority (1) fallacy.",
