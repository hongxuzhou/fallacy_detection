{
    "analysis": "The statement 'We are great, but we can be greater' lacks a clear logical structure with a defined premise-conclusion relationship. It functions as a motivational slogan designed to evoke optimism and pride, lacking substantive reasoning or levered justification. While it contains a comparison (beta form), the lever is not a legitimate evaluative or analogical connection but rather an emotional appeal to collective identity and potential. The statement's primary function is to inspire rather than persuade through logical argumentation, aligning with the 'Slogans' category as it masquerades as an argument without proper form, substance, or lever.",
