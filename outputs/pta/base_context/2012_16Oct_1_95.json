    "analysis": "The statement uses emotional language ('bright future') as the primary lever to justify redirecting war spending to infrastructure, replacing a proper causal or evaluative connection. The form is Alpha (same subject), with the premise (war spending) and conclusion (future brightness) linked by an emotional appeal rather than a valid causal or principled lever. This violates the PTA constraint for Alpha (F\u2192V) by substituting emotion for an evaluative/principled lever. The emotional framing ('bright future') serves as the main argumentative force, fulfilling the criteria for Appeal to Emotion (0).",
