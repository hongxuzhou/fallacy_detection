    "analysis": "The statement cites numerous experts (Nobel laureates, economists, businesspeople) as support for its economic policies. This constitutes a Delta-form argument where the lever is the authority of these individuals. However, the fallacy arises because the argument relies on the sheer number and prestige of experts (popular support) rather than establishing their specific expertise in the relevant policy area or providing evidence of their endorsement. The lever violates the Delta constraint that Z must be a 'relevant expert + in their field + with evidence.' The speaker does not clarify that these experts actually endorse the specific policies, reducing the argument to an appeal to popularity rather than legitimate authority.",
