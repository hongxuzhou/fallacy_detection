Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. The statement is from a 1996 debate, and I need to identify any fallacies using the PTA framework. 

First, I'll parse the statement. The speaker is accusing Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich of letting polluters influence environmental laws and opposing tobacco regulations. They claim that it wasn't them, implying the opponents did it. The context mentions previous statements about tort reform and the speaker's stance on issues.

Looking at the structure: The conclusion seems to be that Dole and Gingrich are responsible for certain actions (letting polluters in, opposing tobacco measures), while the speaker is not. The premises are the accusations against Dole and Gingrich, and the speaker's own actions (signing tort reform). 

Form-wise, the speaker is comparing their actions to those of Dole and Gingrich. The form here might be Beta (a is X because b is X), where the speaker is equating their own actions (not doing X) with the opponents' actions (doing X). But wait, the speaker is actually saying that the opponents did X, not that they did X. So maybe it's a Beta form where the speaker is saying that Dole did X (letting polluters in, opposing tobacco), and the speaker is contrasting their own actions. 

Substance: The statement is about policies (P) regarding environmental laws and tobacco, so substance is Policy. 

The lever here is the comparison between the speaker and Dole/Gingrich. The speaker is attacking the opponents' actions by implying they are responsible for certain policies, while the speaker is not. But the speaker is not providing evidence for these claims. Instead, they are attributing the actions to the opponents without direct proof. 

Wait, the speaker is saying "it wasn't me that let the polluters... that's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did." This is a classic ad hominem, attacking the opponents' character or actions by implying they are responsible for negative policies. However, the structure here might be a Gamma form (a is X because b is Y), but the lever is the comparison between the speaker's actions and the opponents'. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using an inverse Gamma, where the argument is that their position is bad because the opponents are bad. Wait, the speaker isn't attacking the opponents' positions but their actions. Wait, the speaker is saying that the opponents did certain things (letting polluters in, opposing tobacco measures), and the speaker is not responsible. But the speaker is not providing evidence for these claims. 

Looking at the classification rules, if the argument attacks the person instead of the argument, it's Ad Hominem (2). The speaker is not directly refuting the opponents' policies but is instead accusing them of specific actions. However, the statement is more about attributing responsibility for certain policies to the opponents, which could be a form of ad hominem if it's attacking their character or actions without evidence. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using a False Cause (3) by implying that because the opponents are in power, they are responsible for the policies, but that's not exactly a causal link. Or maybe it's an Appeal to Authority if they're citing someone's actions as proof, but that's not the case here. 

Wait, the structure here might be a Beta form where the speaker is saying that Dole did X (letting polluters in), so the speaker is not responsible. But the lever here is the comparison between the speaker and Dole, but the speaker is not establishing a legitimate comparison. Instead, they are making an accusation without evidence. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using an Ad Hominem by attacking the opponents' actions (i.e., their character as being corrupt or not acting in the public interest). However, the specific form here might be an inverse Gamma, where the argument is that their position is correct because the opponents are wrong, but the speaker is not directly attacking the argument but the person. 

Wait, the classification priority says that Ad Hominem is second, so if there's an attack on the person, that's the primary. The speaker is not directly attacking the opponent's arguments but is instead attributing certain actions to the opponents, which could be an ad hominem if it's attacking their character. However, the statement is more about accusing them of specific actions (letting polluters in, opposing tobacco measures) rather than attacking their character. 

Wait, the statement says "it wasn't me that let the polluters... that's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me." This is a form of shifting blame, which could be a False Cause if the speaker is implying that because the opponents are in power, they are responsible, but that's not exactly a causal link. Alternatively, it's an appeal to authority if the speaker is implying that the opponents' actions are the norm, but that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using a Slippery Slope by suggesting that if the opponents are in power, it leads to certain outcomes, but that's not a chain of steps. 

Wait, the main issue here is that the speaker is not providing evidence for the claims that Dole and Gingrich did those actions. They are making accusations without proof, which could be an appeal to emotion (if they're trying to evoke anger or pride by attacking the opponents) or an ad hominem. 

But according to the PTA framework, if the argument is attacking the person's actions or character, it's Ad Hominem (2). The speaker is not directly attacking the opponent's argument but is instead attributing certain actions to them, which could be a form of ad hominem by implication. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using a False Cause by implying that because the opponents are in power, they are responsible for the policies, which is a correlation mistaken for causation. 

But according to the priority rules, if there's an attack on the person, that's second priority. The statement is more about attributing responsibility to the opponents, which could be an ad hominem if it's attacking their character. However, the speaker is not directly attacking the opponent's character but their actions. 

Wait, the classification for Ad Hominem includes "character attacks, tu quoque, bias accusations, offensive labeling." The speaker is not directly calling the opponents names (like labeling them as corrupt) but is accusing them of specific actions. However, if the speaker is implying that the opponents are corrupt or not acting in the public interest by their actions, that could be an ad hominem. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using an inverse Gamma, where the argument is that their position is correct because the opponents are wrong. But the speaker is not directly attacking the argument but the person. 

Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The key is whether the argument is attacking the person's character or actions. If the speaker is saying that the opponents did certain things (letting polluters in, opposing tobacco measures) and thus they are not responsible, but without evidence, that could be an appeal to emotion (if the speaker is trying to evoke anger) or an ad hominem. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using a False Cause by implying that the opponents are responsible for the policies because they are in power, which is a correlation. 

But according to the priority rules, if there's an attack on the person, that's Ad Hominem. The speaker is not directly attacking the opponent's character but is attributing actions to them. However, if the speaker is implying that the opponents are corrupt by their actions, that could be an ad hominem. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using a False Cause by assuming that because the opponents are in power, they are responsible for the policies. 

But the main point here is that the speaker is not providing evidence for the claims about Dole and Gingrich's actions. They are making accusations without proof, which could be an appeal to emotion if they are trying to evoke anger or pride by attacking the opponents. 

Wait, the statement is part of a larger context where the speaker is defending their own actions (signing tort reform) and accusing the opponents of not doing so. The speaker is shifting blame to the opponents, which could be an ad hominem if they are attacking the opponents' character by implying they are responsible for negative policies. 

In the PTA framework, Ad Hominem (2) includes attacks on the person's character. If the speaker is implying that the opponents are corrupt or not acting in the public interest by their actions, that's an ad hominem. 

Therefore, the primary fallacy here is Ad Hominem (2), as the speaker is attacking the opponents' actions (implying they are responsible for negative policies) without evidence, which could be seen as attacking their character. 

Alternatively, if the speaker is using a False Cause by assuming that the opponents' actions are due to their character, that's another angle. But based on the priority rules, Ad Hominem is second, so if there's an attack on the person, that's the primary. 

So the classification would be Ad Hominem (2).
