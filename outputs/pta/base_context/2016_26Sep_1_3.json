    "analysis": "The statement attacks Secretary Clinton's character by attributing the nation's lack of leadership to her, rather than addressing the policy or evidence of leadership. This is an inverse gamma form (attack on the arguer's character) and a classic ad hominem fallacy. The lever is improperly shifted from the policy claim ('no leadership') to a personal attack on Clinton, violating the PTA constraint that arguments must focus on the claim, not the person. The structure 'we have no leadership because it starts with Clinton' shifts focus to her character, not the substance of leadership.",
