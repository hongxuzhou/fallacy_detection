    "analysis": "The statement shifts focus to the audience's personal experience, using emotional appeal to bypass factual evidence. It lacks a logical lever connecting the audience's self-assessment to the broader argument. The structure resembles a beta-form (comparing audience to policy outcomes) but substitutes emotional resonance for legitimate comparison, violating PTA constraints. The rhetorical question evokes pride or concern, using emotion as the primary lever rather than factual or evaluative reasoning.",
