    "analysis": "The statement uses the American people's knowledge of the speaker's leadership as the primary support for the claim that they will win. This is a Delta-form argument where the conclusion (belief in winning) is justified by the authority of the American people's opinion. However, the American people are not a relevant expert or legitimate authority in determining electoral success, violating the PTA constraint that Z (the authority) must be a credible expert in the relevant field. The lever here is improperly framed as an appeal to popularity rather than a valid authority, making this an Appeal to Authority fallacy.",
