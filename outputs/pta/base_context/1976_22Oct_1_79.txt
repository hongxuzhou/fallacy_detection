Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a statement from a 1976 debate, specifically from Jimmy Carter. The statement is comparing inflation rates under Nixon and Ford to those under Johnson and Kennedy, and mentions economic growth and unemployment. The task is to identify any fallacies using the PTA framework.

First, I need to break down the statement into its components. The conclusion seems to be that the current administration (Nixon and Ford) has caused higher inflation and lower economic growth compared to the past. The premises are the statistics about inflation rates and economic growth, along with the unemployment rate and Ford's inaction.

Looking at the form: The statement is comparing two different administrations (Nixon/Ford vs. Johnson/Kennedy) on inflation and economic growth. That seems like a Beta form because it's comparing two different subjects (different administrations) with the same predicate (inflation rate and economic growth). 

Substance-wise, the statement is about factual data (inflation rates, economic growth, unemployment). So the substance is Fact (F). 

The lever here is the comparison between the administrations. The argument is implying that because the current administration has higher inflation and lower growth, their policies are worse. But wait, the PTA Beta form requires a similarity or analogy lever. However, the comparison here is not just about similarity but about causation. The speaker is attributing the current economic issues to the current administration, which might be a False Cause fallacy. 

Wait, but the structure is Beta (a is X because b is X), so the lever should be similarity or analogy. However, the speaker is using the past administrations' performance as a benchmark to show that the current one is worse. But does that require a similarity lever? Or is it a causal lever? 

Alternatively, maybe the form is Alpha. If the subject is the current administration (a) and the predicate is inflation rate (X), and the premise is that the previous administrations had lower inflation (Y), then it's Alpha. But the structure here is more about comparing two different periods, so Beta. 

The key is whether the lever is a valid comparison. The speaker is using the past administrations' data as a benchmark. However, the problem might be that the comparison is not properly justified. For example, the speaker is saying that because the current administration has higher inflation, it's worse, but maybe there are other factors causing inflation that aren't related to the administration. That could be a False Cause fallacy, mistaking correlation for causation. 

Alternatively, if the form is Beta, then the lever should be similarity. But the speaker is not saying that the current administration is similar to the past ones in some way, but rather that their performance is worse. So maybe the structure is Alpha. 

Wait, the statement is structured as "Under the present administration... we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy." So the form here is comparing two different subjects (present administration vs. past presidents) with the same predicate (inflation rate). That's Beta form. The lever is the comparison between the two. However, the Beta form requires a similarity or analogy. But the speaker is using the past data to argue that the present is worse, which might not be a valid analogy. 

Alternatively, maybe the speaker is implying that the current administration's policies are the cause of the higher inflation, which would be a causal lever, making it an Alpha form. But the structure is comparing two different administrations, so Beta. 

Wait, the user's PTA framework says that Beta is when a is X because b is X, requiring similarity/analogy. But here, the speaker is using the past administrations' performance as a standard to show the current is worse. That's not exactly a similarity but a comparison. Maybe the lever is a similarity in terms of the economic indicators, but the argument is about the current being worse, not similar. 

Alternatively, the speaker might be using the past as a standard, which could be a Beta form where the lever is the comparison. However, the problem is that the argument is not just comparing the two but attributing the current economic issues to the current administration's policies, which could be a False Cause. 

Wait, the statement also mentions that Ford hasn't done anything about the unemployment rate. So the argument is that the current administration's inaction is causing the problems. This could be a False Cause fallacy, where the speaker assumes that because the current administration is in power, the problems are their fault, without considering other factors. 

So, looking at the structure, the main argument is that the current administration's policies (or inaction) are causing higher inflation and lower growth. The form would be Alpha (a is X because a is Y), where Y is the administration's policies. The lever here would be the causal link between the administration's actions and the economic outcomes. However, the speaker is comparing to past administrations, which might not be a valid causal lever. 

Alternatively, the structure is Beta (current administration is worse because past administrations were better). The lever is the comparison, but the problem is that the comparison is not properly established. The speaker is using the past as a benchmark but not providing evidence that the current administration's policies are the cause. 

This seems like a False Cause fallacy because the speaker is attributing the current economic issues directly to the current administration, assuming causation without proper evidence. The correlation between the administration and the economic indicators is presented as causation. 

Additionally, the mention of Ford's inaction could be an ad hominem if the speaker is attacking Ford's character instead of addressing the policies. But the statement is more about the economic data and Ford's inaction, which might be a False Cause. 

So, based on the PTA framework, the main issue is the False Cause fallacy. The structure is Alpha (current administration's policies cause the economic issues), but the lever (causal link) is not properly established. The speaker is assuming that because the current administration is in power, the economic problems are their fault, which is a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. 

Therefore, the classification would be False Cause (3).
