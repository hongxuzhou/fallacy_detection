    "analysis": "The statement implies that Donald supported the housing crisis because he expressed a desire for the housing market to collapse. This is a False Cause (3) fallacy, as it incorrectly assumes a causal relationship between Donald's past statement (hoping for collapse) and his responsibility for the crisis. The lever (causal link) is unsupported, conflating a desire with actual causation. The structure follows Alpha (a is X because a is Y) with a failed causal lever, violating PTA constraints.",
