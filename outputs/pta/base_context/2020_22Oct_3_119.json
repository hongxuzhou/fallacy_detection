    "analysis": "The statement 'Our character is on the ballot' frames character as a decisive factor in the election, but the lever used to connect 'character' to the ballot is emotional appeal rather than a logical or evidential connection. The speaker emphasizes 'honor and telling the truth' (emotional values) to evoke a response, substituting proper logical reasoning with emotional language. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0), where emotional states (pride, moral conviction) replace valid levers. The structure is Alpha (a is X because a is Y), but the lever 'honor and truth' is not a causal or evaluative link but an emotional appeal.",
