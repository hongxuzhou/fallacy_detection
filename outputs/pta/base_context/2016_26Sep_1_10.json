    "analysis": "The statement 'She doesn't have the look' is a value judgment (V) about a personal characteristic (appearance) without a valid lever or reasoning. It attacks the opponent's personal attributes (appearance) to undermine their credibility, fitting the Ad Hominem (Type 2) fallacy. The argument shifts focus from the claim to the claimant's personal traits, violating the PTA constraint of attacking the argument itself.",
