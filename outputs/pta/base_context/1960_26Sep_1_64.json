    "analysis": "The statement compares price increases between two administrations but lacks a valid causal lever. It presents a factual comparison (Beta form) without establishing similarity, analogy, or equality as required. While the structure is logical, the context implies a causal claim (Truman's policies caused higher prices) without evidence, violating the False Cause constraint by mistaking correlation for causation.",
