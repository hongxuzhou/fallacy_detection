    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('bad people', 'shootings', 'killed') to evoke fear and justify stop-and-frisk policies. While the premise (high crime rates) is factual, the lever relies on emotional appeal (fear of crime) rather than a valid causal or evaluative connection to the policy. The phrase 'bad people' serves as name-calling, which could be ad hominem, but the primary structural violation is the emotional lever replacing a logical causal link. The argument assumes that high crime necessitates stop-and-frisk without evidence of effectiveness, which aligns with false cause (3) but is more accurately classified as an appeal to emotion due to the dominant emotional framing.",
