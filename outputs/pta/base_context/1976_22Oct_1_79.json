    "analysis": "The statement compares inflation rates and economic growth under Nixon/Ford to Johnson/Kennedy, implying the current administration is responsible for worse outcomes. This is a Beta-form (a is X because b is X) comparison, but the lever is a causal claim (current policies caused inflation) without establishing a valid similarity or analogy. The argument mistakenly assumes correlation (current administration in power) equals causation (their policies caused economic issues), violating the Alpha-FF causal lever constraint. The structure misattributes economic outcomes to the administration without evidence of direct causation, fitting the False Cause fallacy.",
