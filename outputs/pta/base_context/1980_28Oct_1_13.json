    "analysis": "The statement criticizes Carter for advocating policies that increase unemployment to combat inflation, implying a causal link between these actions and inflation reduction. The form is Alpha (same subject), with substance Policy (P), and the lever is a causal claim. However, the argument lacks proper justification for the causal relationship between increasing unemployment and reducing inflation. This violates the constraint for Alpha-PP (Policy-Policy) which requires evaluative/principled levers, not unverified causal claims. The fallacy arises from misinterpreting correlation (Carter's policy) as causation (inflation reduction).",
