Okay, let's tackle this fallacy analysis. The user provided a statement from a 2016 presidential debate, specifically from Donald Trump. The statement is: "And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton."

First, I need to break down the components according to the PTA framework. Let's start by identifying the conclusion and premises. The conclusion here seems to be that there's no leadership, which starts with Secretary Clinton. The premises are about the need for leadership to achieve certain outcomes (like using funds for inner cities) and the implication that Secretary Clinton is the source of the lack of leadership.

Next, determining the form. The form here is a bit complex. The first part talks about leadership leading to quick results (alpha form: a is X because a is Y). Then, the second part contrasts the current lack of leadership and attributes it to Secretary Clinton. This seems like an ad hominem because it's attacking the person (Clinton) instead of addressing the actual argument about leadership. 

Looking at the substance: the statement is about leadership (a policy or value issue). The lever here is the connection between the lack of leadership and Secretary Clinton. The form is inverse gamma, where the argument is attacking the person (Clinton) rather than the policy. 

Now, checking the constraints. The ad hominem fallacy occurs when the argument attacks the person instead of the argument. Here, Trump is saying that the lack of leadership starts with Clinton, which is an attack on her character rather than addressing the actual issue of leadership. This fits the inverse gamma form, where the argument's validity is undermined by attacking the person. 

Also, there's an appeal to emotion here, but the primary violation is the ad hominem. According to the priority rules, ad hominem is second in priority after slogans. But since the statement isn't a slogan, ad hominem is the main issue. 

I should check if there's any other fallacy. The statement doesn't seem to use an authority or emotional appeal as the main lever. It's more about attacking the person. So the primary fallacy here is ad hominem, specifically the general ad hominem attack on Clinton's character.
