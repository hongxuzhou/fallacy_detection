    "analysis": "The statement 'We have to practice what we preach' is a Value (V) claim asserting a moral obligation. It follows an Alpha form (same subject) with an evaluative lever (principled consistency). The structure aligns with valid PTA constraints for VV (Value-Value) arguments using evaluative levers. No structural violations are present. The context of contrasting with the Communists is implied but not directly part of the statement itself. The argument is logically coherent and does not commit any fallacy.",
