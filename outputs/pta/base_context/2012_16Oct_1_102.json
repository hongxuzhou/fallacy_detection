{
    "analysis": "The statement 'If I become president, I'll get America working again' presents a conditional policy claim (P) with an alpha-form structure (same subject: the speaker; predicate: economic recovery). The lever is implied to be the speaker's presidency causing economic recovery, but no causal, evaluative, or principled justification is provided. This violates the alpha-form constraint for policy substance, which requires a valid lever (e.g., evidence, principles, or criteria) to establish the causal link. The argument assumes causation without substantiation, fitting the False Cause (3) fallacy. While the statement has a logical structure, its lack of a proper lever makes it a single unsupported causal claim.",
