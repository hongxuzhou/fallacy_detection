{
    "analysis": "The statement is a tautological repetition of the same subject ('this issue') and predicate ('divides Americans deeply'), forming an Alpha (a is X because a is Y) structure. The substance is a Value (V) judgment about societal division. The lever is implicitly emotional, using the concept of division to evoke fear or concern about societal fragmentation. This violates the Alpha constraint by substituting emotional appeal (lever) for a valid causal, evaluative, or principled connection. The statement lacks substantive reasoning to justify why the issue divides Americans, instead relying on emotional resonance to frame the argument.",
