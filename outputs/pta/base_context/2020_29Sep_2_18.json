    "analysis": "The statement 'You don't have it in your blood' attacks Joe Biden's inherent qualities (character) rather than addressing substantive arguments. This aligns with Ad Hominem (2) as it shifts focus to the opponent's personal traits ('blood' implying innate capability) instead of engaging with the claim. The lever 'in your blood' functions as an emotional appeal to dismiss the opponent's suitability, but the primary violation is the personal attack on character.",
