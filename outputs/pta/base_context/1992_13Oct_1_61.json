    "analysis": "The statement compares the current 4-year period's job decline to the Hoover era, using historical context to evoke emotional fear of economic collapse. While the form is Beta (a is X because b is X), the lever relies on emotional association with Hoover's era (a negative historical event) rather than a legitimate analogy. The argument substitutes emotional fear for logical comparison, violating PTA constraints by using emotion as the primary lever. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0), as the emotional weight of the Hoover reference replaces valid reasoning.",
