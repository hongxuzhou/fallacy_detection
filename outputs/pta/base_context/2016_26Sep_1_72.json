    "analysis": "The statement attributes the doubling of debt under the Obama administration to poor policy decisions, implying a direct causal link between the administration's actions and the debt increase. However, the argument fails to establish a valid causal lever (e.g., evidence that the policies directly caused the debt increase). Instead, it uses a correlation (debt levels) as if it were a direct cause, which violates the Alpha-form constraint requiring a causal/effect lever. The emotional tone ('You can't do what you're looking to do') may amplify the argument, but the primary structural violation is the false causal assumption.",
