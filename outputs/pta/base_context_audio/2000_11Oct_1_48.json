    "analysis": "The statement advocates for specific policies (tough enforcement, affirmative action, hate crimes laws) to address structural prejudice. The form is Alpha (policy X because of the problem Y), but the lever (causal link between these policies and solving prejudice) lacks justification. The speaker assumes these policies alone will eliminate systemic issues without addressing underlying causes, violating the Alpha-FF constraint by misrepresenting correlation as causation.",
