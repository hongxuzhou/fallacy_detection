    "analysis": "The statement attributes 'significant breakthroughs' in peace efforts to the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. This is an Alpha-form (a is X because a is Y) with Fact (F) substance. The lever is the Gulf War and Cold War's end as causes, but the causal link is not substantiated. The argument assumes a direct causal relationship between these events and peace progress without establishing a valid lever (e.g., how the Gulf War specifically led to breakthroughs). This violates the Alpha-FF constraint requiring causal/effect levers, constituting a False Cause (3) fallacy.",
