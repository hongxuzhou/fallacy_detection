    "analysis": "The statement compares the speaker's plan to a balanced budget with the president's failure to achieve it, implying causation without evidence. This violates the False Cause (3) constraint by mistaking correlation (president's failure) for causation (speaker's plan will succeed). The lever is improperly used to create a direct causal link between the president's actions and the speaker's policy outcome.",
