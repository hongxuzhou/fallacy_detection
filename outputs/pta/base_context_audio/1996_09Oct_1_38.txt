Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context for the given statement. The context is from a 1996 debate, and the speaker is talking about Affirmative Action. The specific statement in question is about a California ballot measure related to Affirmative Action, mentioning Senator Dole's legislation and Mr. Kemp's actions against it, now endorsing it.

For STEP 1: Context Extraction. The speaker is a presidential or vice-presidential candidate (since it's a debate), likely a Republican given the mention of Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp (probably Jack Kemp, a Republican). The claim is that there's a specific measure on the ballot in California, part of legislation by Dole, and Kemp's shift from opposing to endorsing it. The immediate argumentative goal is to show that Kemp's endorsement of the measure (which he previously opposed) is a sign of the measure's validity or necessity, possibly to counter opposition.

Now, STEP 2: Fallacy Analysis. The target statement is: "There is a specific measure on the ballot in California. It was embodied in legislation, introduced by Senator Dole, to apply to the whole nation. Mr. Kemp campaigned against it, spoke against it, wrote letters against it, went to California to fight against it, and now has endorsed it."

Looking at the structure, the speaker is using Kemp's change in position as evidence for the measure's merits. But wait, the form here seems to be a Beta (a is X because b is X), comparing Kemp's current endorsement to his past opposition. The lever here is the change in Kemp's stance. However, the fallacy here might be that the speaker is implying that Kemp's endorsement is a sign of the measure's correctness, but that's not necessarily a valid comparison. The speaker is attacking Kemp's past opposition (which is an ad hominem) or maybe using the change in position as a causal link (false cause). Alternatively, it could be a slippery slope if they suggest that the measure's passage will lead to Kemp's endorsement, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the statement is pointing out that Kemp changed his stance. The argument here might be that since Kemp now supports it, it's a good measure. But that's not a logical argument. The fallacy here could be an appeal to authority if they're suggesting Kemp's endorsement is a reason to support the measure, but Kemp isn't an expert. Alternatively, it's an ad hominem if they're attacking Kemp's previous opposition. Wait, the speaker isn't attacking Kemp's character but rather pointing out his change in position. However, the structure might be a false cause, assuming that Kemp's endorsement is a result of the measure's merits, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, it's a slippery slope if the argument is that Kemp's endorsement leads to more support, but the statement doesn't go that far. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using the fact that Kemp changed his mind as a sign that the measure is good, which might be a false cause. The form here is Beta: the measure is good because Kemp now supports it (since he previously opposed). But the lever is the change in Kemp's stance, which isn't a valid similarity. The speaker is equating Kemp's endorsement with the measure's validity, which might be a false cause. Wait, but the structure is more like a Beta form where the measure is X because Kemp is X (now endorsing). But the lever here is the similarity in Kemp's stance. However, the argument is that because Kemp now supports it, the measure is good, which is a false cause. Alternatively, it's an appeal to authority if they're using Kemp's endorsement as a reason, but that's not a proper authority. 

Alternatively, the speaker is using the fact that Kemp changed his position, which could be an ad hominem if they're implying that Kemp's previous opposition was wrong, but that's not the case here. The main issue is that the argument is using Kemp's endorsement as a reason for the measure's validity, which might be an appeal to authority (if Kemp is considered an authority) or a false cause. Since the speaker is not citing Kemp as an expert but rather as someone who changed his mind, it might be a false cause. The lever here is the correlation between Kemp's endorsement and the measure's merit, which is a false cause. 

Wait, the structure is Beta: the measure is good because Kemp now supports it (since he previously opposed). The lever is the similarity between Kemp's endorsement and the measure's validity. However, this is a false cause because the endorsement doesn't necessarily prove the measure's validity. So the fallacy here is False Cause (3). Alternatively, it could be an appeal to authority if Kemp is considered an authority, but the statement doesn't indicate that. So the primary fallacy is False Cause.
