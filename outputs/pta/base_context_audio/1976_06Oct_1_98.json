    "analysis": "The statement claims the U.S. initiative in southern Africa prevented Soviet/Cuban dominance, implying a direct causal relationship (False Cause). This violates the Alpha-FF constraint by asserting causation without evidence of a causal lever. The argument assumes their actions were the sole factor preventing Soviet influence, ignoring alternative explanations. The emotional appeal to 'good conscience' (0) is secondary to the primary structural violation of False Cause.",
