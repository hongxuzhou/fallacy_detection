    "analysis": "The speaker's argument assumes a direct causal link between high healthcare costs and the need for technology (introducing high tech to reduce costs). This is a False Cause (3) fallacy, as the causal lever is not properly established. The speaker links high costs to technology adoption without sufficient evidence, misrepresenting the relationship between the premise (high costs) and conclusion (technology necessity).",
