    "analysis": "The statement uses emotional appeals ('hope and belief', 'American dream') as the primary lever, replacing a valid causal or evaluative connection. The speaker claims that allocating funds will reverse home ownership decline without providing evidence of a direct causal link, relying instead on emotional rhetoric to justify the policy. This violates the Alpha form's requirement for a causal/effect lever, substituting emotion as the justification.",
