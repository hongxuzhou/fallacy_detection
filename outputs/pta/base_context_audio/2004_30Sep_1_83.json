{
    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('wilting', 'wavered') to assert personal resolve without providing substantive evidence or logical reasoning. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the emotional state of determination is used as the lever, replacing a valid argumentative structure. The speaker's focus on personal steadfastness avoids addressing the actual policy debate, leveraging pride and defiance to deflect from the core argument.",
