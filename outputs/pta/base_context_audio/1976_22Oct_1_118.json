    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('inspired', 'great things', 'positive') to evoke hope and unity without providing concrete evidence or logical reasoning. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the lever is purely emotional, substituting for a valid argumentative structure. The speaker avoids specific policy claims (V) or causal links (FF), instead relying on affective appeal to inspire action.",
