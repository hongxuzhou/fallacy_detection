    "analysis": "The statement claims the plan is better because it leads to a growing economy and healthier families. This is a policy claim (P) using an Alpha-form argument (a is X because a is Y). The lever is the causal relationship between the plan and its outcomes, but no evidence or causal mechanism is provided. This violates the Alpha-FF requirement for causal levers, constituting a False Cause fallacy by assuming causation without justification.",
