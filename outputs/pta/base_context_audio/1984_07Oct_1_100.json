    "analysis": "The speaker reclassifies abortion as a constitutional issue rather than a religious one. This is a Beta-form argument (a is X because b is X) where the lever is the comparison between religion and the Constitution. However, the speaker fails to establish a valid similarity or analogy between the two domains, instead using the Constitution as a non-sequitur to avoid addressing the religious aspect. This violates the Beta constraint requiring legitimate comparison, constituting a False Cause (type 3) by misrepresenting the causal relationship between the issue's classification and the Constitution.",
