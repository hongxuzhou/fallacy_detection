    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('madness', 'heavens free from war') to frame the proposal as inherently dangerous, substituting emotional reaction for logical reasoning. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) by leveraging fear and moral outrage as the primary lever, violating PTA's requirement that emotional states cannot justify factual or policy claims. The speaker's focus on visceral reactions ('stop this madness') rather than verifiable arguments about verification mechanisms or computational risks constitutes a structural violation of Alpha-form constraints.",
