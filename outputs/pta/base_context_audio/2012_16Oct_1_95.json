    "analysis": "The statement attributes high unemployment to Obama's policies without establishing a causal link (False Cause). The speaker claims 'the president's policies have been exercised... and they haven't put Americans back to work,' implying direct causation (A\u2192B) without evidence of a lever connecting policies to unemployment. This violates the Alpha-FF constraint requiring causal/effect levers. The emotional tone (high arousal/dominance) may amplify the fallacy but is secondary to the structural violation.",
