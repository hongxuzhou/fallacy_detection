    "analysis": "The statement uses emotional language ('learning to live with it', 'dangerous') to provoke fear and uncertainty about a situation, replacing logical reasoning with emotional appeal. The speaker's tone and rhetorical questions exploit emotional instincts to shift focus from factual assessment to visceral reaction, violating PTA's constraint that emotion cannot substitute for proper levers in any form.",
