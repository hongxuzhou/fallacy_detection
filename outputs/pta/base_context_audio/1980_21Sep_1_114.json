    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('unborn child has a right to be wanted', 'most personal intimate decision') to frame abortion as a moral and personal issue, evoking emotional responses rather than presenting logical or factual arguments. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the lever is emotional states (morality, personal freedom) rather than valid causal, evaluative, or evidential connections. The structure resembles a Beta form (comparing the decision to a morally charged concept) but relies on emotional similarity rather than legitimate analogy.",
