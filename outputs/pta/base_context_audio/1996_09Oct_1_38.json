    "analysis": "The speaker uses Mr. Kemp's change in position (from opposition to endorsement) as evidence for the measure's validity. This is a False Cause (3) fallacy, as it incorrectly assumes that Kemp's endorsement (a correlation) implies the measure's merit (a causal link). The lever is improperly used to assert causation where none is established.",
