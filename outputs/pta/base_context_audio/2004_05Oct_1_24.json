    "analysis": "The statement links the Iraq War to the threat of WMDs and terrorism, asserting causation without sufficient evidence. The lever (causal link between Iraq's actions and the threat) is flawed, as the premise about WMDs was later discredited. This violates the Alpha-form constraint for FF (fact-fact) by misrepresenting correlation as causation.",
