    "analysis": "The speaker argues that the bills are not extreme because a majority of Republicans voted against them. This is a Beta-form (a is X because b is X) with an invalid lever, as the majority's vote does not logically indicate the extremity of the bills. The lever (majority opinion) is improperly used as an authority, violating the PTA constraint that Z must be a relevant expert. This constitutes an Appeal to Authority (1) by treating popular opinion as a legitimate authority.",
