    "analysis": "The statement compares Nixon's inaction on Cuba to his stance on Formosa/Quemoy, implying a causal link between his actions on one issue and his commitments on another. This violates the Beta form's requirement for legitimate comparison, as the contexts (Cuba vs. Formosa) are fundamentally different. The lever (similarity in inaction) is improperly used to suggest Nixon's inconsistency, which is a False Cause fallacy by misrepresenting correlation as causation.",
