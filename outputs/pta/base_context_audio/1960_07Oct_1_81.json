    "analysis": "The statement implies Nixon lacks experience based on a previous debate claim, using a circular premise (Kennedy's own assertion) as the lever. This violates the Alpha form's requirement for a valid causal/effect lever, as the premise (previous debate) is not substantiated evidence. The argument assumes Nixon's lack of experience is inherent due to his role, which is a direct causal link without justification, fitting False Cause (3).",
