    "analysis": "The speaker compares the opponent's plan to Clinton's proposal, claiming it's three times bigger and implying it's similarly misleading. This violates the Beta form by using an illegitimate comparison (Clinton's ad was misleading, but the current plan's size isn't directly tied to the same claim). The lever (comparison) lacks a valid similarity/analogy, creating a false causal link between the size of the plan and its misleading nature. This matches False Cause (3) as the speaker misinterprets correlation (plan size) as causation (misleading intent).",
