    "analysis": "The statement presents a correlation between the administration's tenure and increased poverty rates (1 out of 2 children in Cleveland in poverty, 4 million more Americans in poverty) without establishing a causal link. This violates the Alpha-form constraint for Fact (F) by assuming causation (administration's policies caused poverty) without a valid causal lever (e.g., evidence of policy impact). The argument misinterprets correlation as causation, fitting the False Cause (3) fallacy.",
