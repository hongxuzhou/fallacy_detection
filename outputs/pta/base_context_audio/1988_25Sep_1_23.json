    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('murders a police officer', 'rape and brutalization') to evoke fear and moral outrage, framing capital punishment as a necessary response to violence. This replaces logical reasoning with emotional appeal, violating PTA's constraint that emotion cannot substitute for proper levers in Alpha (FF/VF) or Delta forms. The speaker's focus on visceral reactions to crime (rather than policy arguments) aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0).",
