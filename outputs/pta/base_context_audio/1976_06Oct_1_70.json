    "analysis": "The statement links economic weakness at home to global weakness through a causal claim (Alpha form, FF). However, it lacks a proper causal lever, instead relying on emotionally charged language ('terrible disarray', 'weaken us') to imply a direct connection. This violates the FF constraint by substituting emotional appeal for evidence of causation, constituting a False Cause (3) fallacy.",
