    "analysis": "The statement argues that law and order is needed in inner cities because African-American and Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by issues. This follows an Alpha form (a is X because a is Y) where the premise (affected groups) is used to justify the policy (law and order). The lever assumes a direct causal link between the groups' suffering and the need for law and order, which is a false causal relationship. The emotional tone ('unfair') may amplify the argument, but the primary structural violation is a false cause.",
