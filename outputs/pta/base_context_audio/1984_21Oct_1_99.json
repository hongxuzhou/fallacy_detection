    "analysis": "The statement assumes that demonstrating a defensive weapon will directly lead to Soviet cooperation without establishing a valid causal or analogical link. This violates the Beta form's requirement for legitimate comparison, as the lever (similarity between the weapon and Soviet willingness) is not substantiated. The argument mistakenly equates the weapon's existence with the Soviets' desire to negotiate, creating a false causal connection.",
