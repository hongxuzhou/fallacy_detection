    "analysis": "The statement 'Look at us closely' shifts focus to the speaker's character and reputation, bypassing the actual argument. This aligns with Ad Hominem (2) by attacking the arguer's character (reputation for honor and truth) rather than addressing the opponent's claim. The speaker uses personal attributes as a lever to deflect from substantive policy discussion, violating the PTA constraint that arguments must target claims, not individuals.",
