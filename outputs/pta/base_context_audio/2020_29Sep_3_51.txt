Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to do the context extraction. The context is from a 2020 presidential debate. The speaker is a U.S. presidential candidate, probably Trump since the date is 2020-09-29. The statement is about not allowing something to happen, referring to core values and teaching people that the country is horrible and to hate it. The immediate argumentative goal is to oppose the opposing candidate's policies by attacking their influence on people's perceptions of the country.

Now, moving to the fallacy analysis. The target statement is: "And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to allow that to happen." 

Looking at the PTA framework. The speaker is using emotional language here. The statement is attacking the opponent's policies by suggesting they are promoting hatred, which is an emotional appeal. The form here seems to be a Beta or Alpha? Let me check. The structure is "they were teaching people to hate our country" (claim) and the speaker's response. The lever here is the emotional impact of hatred. 

The substance is a Value (V) statement about the country's values. The lever is emotional, using the idea of hatred to evoke a negative emotion. According to the PTA patterns, Appeal to Emotion (0) is when emotion replaces the proper lever. In this case, the speaker is using the emotional reaction to hatred as the main argument, not providing a logical connection. 

The key indicators are the use of "hate" which is a strong emotional term. The speaker is not providing evidence or a logical reason why the opponent's policies are harmful, but instead is appealing to the audience's emotions. This fits the Appeal to Emotion fallacy, specifically using fear or anger. 

Checking the classification priority rules, since there's no slogan, ad hominem, or other fallacies, the primary is Appeal to Emotion. So the classification should be 0.
