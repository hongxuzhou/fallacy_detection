    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language about job loss and economic despair to evoke fear and pity, replacing logical reasoning with emotional appeal. The lever is the audience's emotional response to job loss, not a causal or evaluative argument. This violates the PTA constraint by using emotion as the primary lever in a Delta-form argument (q is wrong because it causes emotional distress).",
