    "analysis": "The statement uses the historical example of Hitler's appeasement to argue against current policy, employing a Beta form (a is X because b is X) by comparing the current situation to Hitler's actions.

This violates the PTA constraint by substituting emotion for a legitimate similarity lever, constituting an Appeal to Emotion (0).",
