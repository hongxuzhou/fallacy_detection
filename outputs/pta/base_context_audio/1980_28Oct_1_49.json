    "analysis": "The speaker cites George Bush's and Business Week's criticisms of the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal to argue its validity. This uses the authority of these sources as a lever (Delta-form) but fails to establish their relevance or expertise in economic policy. Additionally, the term 'voodoo economics' is a name-calling label, which directly attacks the proposal's credibility through emotional association, fitting the ad hominem (2) fallacy. The lever is improperly used as an authority without evidence, and the label serves as an emotional appeal.",
