    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('horrible things', 'terror state') to frame the Iran deal as inherently bad without providing logical evidence. The lever is the emotional reaction to the term 'terror state' rather than a valid causal or comparative relationship. This violates the PTA constraint by substituting emotion for a proper lever in a Beta-form argument (comparing the Iran deal to a 'terror state').",
