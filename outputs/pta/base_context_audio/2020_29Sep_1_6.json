    "analysis": "The statement attacks the opponent's use of the word 'smart' as a personal affront rather than addressing the substantive claim. This is an Ad Hominem (Type 2) fallacy, where the speaker shifts focus from the argument to the opponent's character by labeling their language as unacceptable. The lever is the word 'smart' itself, used as a weaponized label rather than a logical connection to the claim about Delaware State University.",
