    "analysis": "The speaker contrasts their own fiscal responsibility record with the president's unaccounted expenses, implying the president's fiscal irresponsibility. This uses a Beta-form argument (comparing the speaker's actions to the president's) but lacks a legitimate comparison. The lever (similarity in fiscal responsibility) is not justified, violating Beta constraints by failing to establish a valid analogy. The speaker's personal record is not a proper authority, making this an Appeal to Authority (1).",
