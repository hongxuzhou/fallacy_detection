    "analysis": "The statement asserts leadership through past actions (alpha-form: 'I know how to lead because I've shown it'). The lever is the claim of demonstrated leadership via decisions, but it lacks causal justification (e.g., no evidence that past decisions directly prove leadership capability). This violates the Alpha-form constraint requiring a causal/effect lever, fitting the False Cause (3) fallacy. The emotional tone (confidence, assertiveness) may amplify the claim but does not constitute the primary structural violation.",
