    "analysis": "The statement equates China's currency manipulation with not playing by trade rules, implying a direct causal link (False Cause). The speaker assumes that artificially holding down currency values inherently violates trade rules without establishing a valid causal lever. This violates the Alpha form's requirement for a causal/effect lever, as the connection between currency manipulation and rule-breaking is not substantiated. The argument relies on an unproven assumption rather than evidence, fitting the False Cause (3) fallacy.",
