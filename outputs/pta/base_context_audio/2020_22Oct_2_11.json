    "analysis": "The statement attacks the opponent's past performance (eight years to 'get it done') as a personal failure, shifting focus from policy outcomes to the individual's record. This aligns with inverse gamma (ad hominem) by dismissing the argument based on the person's perceived inadequacy rather than addressing the claim itself. The lever is the implication that not achieving goals equals personal failure, which is a character attack.",
