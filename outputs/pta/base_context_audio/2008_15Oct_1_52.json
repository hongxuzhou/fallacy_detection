    "analysis": "The statement argues that adopting the same policies as the previous eight years is risky, implying a causal link between past failure and future risk. This violates the Alpha (FF) constraint by assuming a direct causal relationship without establishing a valid lever (e.g., identical conditions or evidence of recurrence). The argument relies on correlation (past failure) as if it guarantees future failure, which is a classic False Cause fallacy.",
