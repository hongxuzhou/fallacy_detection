    "analysis": "The statement uses a specific example of $3 million spent on bear DNA research to argue against earmarking, implying a causal link between earmarking and wasteful spending. This violates the False Cause (3) constraint by assuming a direct causal relationship between the specific instance (bear study) and the broader claim (corruption and out-of-control spending) without establishing a valid lever. The example is not representative of all earmarking practices, and the argument relies on a single case to generalize, which is a classic false cause fallacy.",
