    "analysis": "The speaker uses emotionally charged examples (Columbine, Paducah) to evoke fear and justify gun control measures, replacing logical causation with emotional appeal. The lever is the emotional impact of these events, not a valid causal or evaluative connection between criminal gun access and the proposed policy. This violates the PTA constraint by substituting emotion for a proper lever in a Beta-form argument.",
