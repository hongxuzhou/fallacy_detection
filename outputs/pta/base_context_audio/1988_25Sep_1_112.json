    "analysis": "The statement 'I am the change' is a slogan that lacks logical structure, relying on emotional appeal and repetition rather than substantive argumentation. It uses a striking phrase to provoke emotional response without providing evidence or logical connections, violating the PTA constraint of requiring form, substance, and lever. The primary violation is the absence of a valid argumentative structure, classifying it as a slogan.",
