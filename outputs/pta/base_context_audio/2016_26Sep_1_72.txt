Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context. The user provided a statement from a 2016 debate. The speaker is talking about energy policies and job loss, specifically mentioning Michigan and Ohio. The main claim is that current energy policies are a disaster and that jobs are being lost, so they need better policies to keep jobs and incentivize companies.

Now, for the fallacy analysis. The statement uses emotional language like "putting a lot of people out of work," "losing so much," and "so many of their jobs and companies are just leaving." The speaker is appealing to the audience's emotions about job loss and economic hardship. 

Looking at the PTA framework, the structure here seems to be an appeal to emotion. The speaker is using the negative emotions of job loss and economic despair to sway the audience. The lever here is the emotional impact rather than a logical argument. The form might be Alpha, where the speaker is claiming that the policies are bad because they cause job loss, but the lever is emotional rather than causal. 

The key indicators here are the use of fear (job loss) and anger (economic damage) as the primary motivators. The speaker isn't providing evidence or logical connections but is instead invoking emotional responses. This fits the Appeal to Emotion (0) fallacy. 

I should check if there's another possible fallacy, like False Cause, but the statement doesn't directly link the policies to job loss causally. It's more about the emotional impact. Also, there's no ad hominem or appeal to authority here. So the primary fallacy is Appeal to Emotion.
