Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to do the context extraction. The context is from a 1988 debate, and the speaker is talking about being the change. The target statement is "I want to keep this expansion going. Yes, we want change but we are the change. I am the change." 

So, for STEP 1: WHO is making the statement? The speaker is a presidential candidate, probably George H.W. Bush since the date is 1988-09-25. The claim is that they are the change, responding to the idea of needing change. The immediate argumentative goal is to assert their candidacy as the solution to the country's issues, positioning themselves as the necessary change.

Now, STEP 2: Fallacy analysis. The statement uses "I am the change" which is a slogan. It's a short, catchy phrase meant to provoke emotional response. According to the PTA framework, slogans are non-arguments without proper form, substance, or lever. The structure here doesn't have a logical connection; it's more about repetition and emotional appeal. The classification priority says slogans come first. So even if there's an appeal to emotion, the primary issue is the slogan. The speaker is using a slogan to make their point without providing evidence or logical structure. Therefore, the fallacy is Slogans (5).
