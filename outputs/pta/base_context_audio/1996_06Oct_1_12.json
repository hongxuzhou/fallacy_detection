    "analysis": "The statement claims that establishing a bipartisan commission will 'take it out of politics' and solve campaign finance issues. This is a False Cause (3) fallacy, as it assumes a direct causal relationship between the commission's structure (non-political members) and the solution, without evidence of how this structure will inherently address the problem. The lever (assumed causation) violates the Alpha-FF constraint by failing to establish a valid causal link between the commission's composition and the desired outcome.",
