    "analysis": "The statement equates the absence of private housing in urban areas with a 'socialist economy' (Alpha form: 'urban economy is socialist because there's no private housing'). The lever assumes a direct causal link between housing policy and economic system without evidence, violating the FF constraint's requirement for causal/effect levers. This is a False Cause fallacy (3) by mistaking correlation (lack of private housing) for causation (socialist economy).",
