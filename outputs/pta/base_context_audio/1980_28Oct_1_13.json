    "analysis": "The statement shifts blame for inflation from the people to the government, presenting a causal claim without evidence. This violates the False Cause (3) constraint by misattributing inflation to the government's lifestyle, ignoring other factors and creating a direct causal link without justification. The structure is an Alpha-FF (fact-fact) form where the lever (government's lifestyle) is improperly used as a cause for inflation.",
