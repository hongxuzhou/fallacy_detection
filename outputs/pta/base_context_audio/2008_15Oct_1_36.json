    "analysis": "The speaker uses emotionally charged language ('mortgaged your children's futures', 'lifelong service') to evoke strong feelings about education and dedication, bypassing logical evidence. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) by substituting emotional appeal for substantive reasoning, violating PTA's requirement that levers must connect claims logically. The emotional state ('concern for children') is used as the primary justification for the proposal, lacking a valid causal or evaluative lever.",
