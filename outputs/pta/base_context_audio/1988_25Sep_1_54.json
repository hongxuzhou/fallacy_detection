{
    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language about a victim's trauma ('rape and brutalization of the family') to evoke sympathy and moral outrage, bypassing logical reasoning. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the lever is purely emotional (fear/pity) rather than a valid causal, evaluative, or analogical connection. The speaker shifts focus from policy discussion to emotional manipulation of the audience's reaction to the victim's suffering.",
