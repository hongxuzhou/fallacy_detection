    "analysis": "The statement uses a Beta-form argument (a is X because b is X) by equating New York's success with stop-and-frisk to Chicago's potential success. However, the lever (similarity) is not justified, as the speaker assumes the policy's effectiveness in one context will directly apply to another without addressing contextual differences. This violates the Beta constraint requiring legitimate comparison, leading to a false cause fallacy by mistaking correlation for causation.",
