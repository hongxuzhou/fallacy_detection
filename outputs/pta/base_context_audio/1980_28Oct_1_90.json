    "analysis": "The speaker cites a HEW secretary's testimony about $7 billion in fraud and waste as evidence of government inefficiency. This lever is structured as an Appeal to Authority (1), where the secretary is presented as a credible expert in their field. However, the context reveals the secretary was under Carter, the opponent, which introduces a potential bias. While the expert is relevant, the argument subtly attacks Carter's administration by implying his policies enabled waste, shifting focus from the factual claim to the opponent's credibility. This aligns with the Ad Hominem (2) fallacy by associating the opponent's administration with wastefulness rather than addressing the claim directly.",
