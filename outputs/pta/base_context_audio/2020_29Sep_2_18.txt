Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, the context extraction. The user provided a statement from a 2020 debate where the speaker is addressing Joe, saying, "You could've never done that, Joe." The context mentions the speaker's emotional tone with high arousal and dominance, which might be relevant.

For STEP 1, I need to extract who is making the statement, what they're claiming, and why it matters. The speaker is likely a presidential or vice-presidential candidate, possibly Trump, given the 2020 context. The claim is that Joe (probably Biden) couldn't have done the job the speaker did. The immediate argumentative goal is to undermine Biden's capability by comparing their past performance, which is a common tactic in debates to attack the opponent's qualifications.

Now STEP 2: Fallacy analysis using PTA. The statement is a direct comparison, so checking the form. The structure seems like a Beta form (a is X because b is X), where the speaker is asserting that Joe couldn't do the job because they (the speaker) did. But the lever here is the comparison between the speaker's performance and Joe's. However, the speaker isn't providing evidence or a legitimate comparison; it's more of a personal attack. 

Looking at the fallacy types, Ad Hominem (2) is about attacking the person instead of the argument. The statement doesn't directly attack Joe's character but implies he's incapable based on the speaker's own achievements. However, the phrasing "you could never have done the job" might be a personal attack by implying Joe is unqualified, which could be an ad hominem. Alternatively, it might be a False Cause (3) if they're attributing the job's success to their own actions without causation. But the key here is the comparison. 

Wait, the PTA Beta form requires a legitimate comparison. The speaker is using their own performance as a benchmark, but without establishing a valid analogy or similarity. The lever here is the comparison, but if the comparison isn't valid, that's a Beta violation. However, the statement is more about personal capability, so maybe it's an Ad Hominem. The speaker is attacking Joe's ability by contrasting their own success, which could be a form of Ad Hominem (bias ad hominem, implying Joe benefits from his stance). 

Alternatively, the emotional tone mentioned in the context might point to Appeal to Emotion (0), but the primary structure seems to be attacking the person's capability. Since the classification priority rules state that Ad Hominem is second, but Slogans first. However, the statement isn't a slogan. The main issue is the attack on Joe's ability, which fits Ad Hominem. So classification 2.
