Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context. The user provided a statement from a 1996 debate. The speaker is pointing out that drug use doubled in Arkansas when the other person was governor. Then they mention cutting the drug czar's office by 83% and reducing interdiction. The immediate argumentative goal is to criticize the opponent's policies on drug control.

Now, for the fallacy analysis. The statement seems to be comparing the opponent's actions (cutting the drug czar's office) to the increase in drug use. The speaker is implying that the opponent's policies caused the increase. But wait, the speaker is saying that when the opponent was governor, drug use doubled, and now they've cut the czar's office, which might be a response. But the connection here is that the opponent's actions led to increased drug use. However, the speaker is using the fact that drug use doubled under the opponent's governance to argue that their policies are bad. But is there a causal link here?

Looking at the PTA framework, this seems like an Alpha form (a is X because a is Y). The substance here is a Fact (F) because it's about drug use statistics. The lever would be the causal relationship between the opponent's policies (Y) and the increase in drug use (X). But the speaker is not providing evidence that the opponent's policies directly caused the increase. They're just correlating the two events. That's a classic False Cause fallacy (3), where correlation is mistaken for causation. The speaker is implying that because drug use went up while the opponent was in office, their policies are to blame, but there's no proof of a direct cause-effect relationship. Also, the speaker might be using emotional language ("cut the drug czar's office" as a negative action), but the primary issue here is the causal link. So the main fallacy is False Cause. However, I should check if there's another possible fallacy. The speaker is attacking the opponent's policies by linking them to negative outcomes, but that's more of a False Cause. Ad Hominem isn't here because they're not attacking the person's character directly. Appeal to Authority isn't present. So the main fallacy is False Cause (3).
