    "analysis": "The statement shifts focus to emotional appeals about individual hardship (working harder, feeding children, education) to argue policy effectiveness, violating PTA's alpha-form constraint by using emotional states as the lever instead of factual or evaluative reasoning. The speaker frames the debate as a moral imperative based on personal suffering, not objective metrics, which replaces proper levers with emotional arousal.",
