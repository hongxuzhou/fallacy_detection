    "analysis": "The statement cites Governor Jim Hunt's plan as a basis for its own proposal, implying credibility through association. This violates the PTA constraint for Beta form (a is X because b is X) by using an unverified claim about Hunt's plan's success as a lever. The speaker assumes Hunt's plan is authoritative without evidence, which constitutes an Appeal to Authority (1) as the lever relies on non-expert political authority rather than substantiated evidence.",
