Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the context for the given statement. The context is from a 1960 debate between JFK and Nixon. The speaker here is JFK, responding to Nixon's statement about commitments to Formosa and Quemoy. The immediate argument is about treaty commitments and the implications of Chinese attacks on those islands.

Now, the target statement by JFK is: "I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war. But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty. Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States."

For the fallacy analysis, I need to check the PTA constraints. Let's break down the structure. The speaker is comparing Nixon's stance on guaranteeing islands near China to his inaction regarding Cuba. The form here seems to be a Beta (a is X because b is X) where the comparison is between the two situations. The lever is the similarity in the actions (guaranteeing islands vs. not protesting Cuba's seizure). However, the comparison is flawed because the contexts are different: Cuba is a U.S. territory, while the islands are part of China. The lever here is an improper analogy, making it a False Cause (3) because it's equating two different scenarios without proper justification. Alternatively, it might be an Appeal to Authority if Nixon's actions are cited as authority, but the main issue is the faulty comparison. Since the comparison is based on similarity without valid reasoning, it's a False Cause. Also, the emotional tone might suggest Appeal to Emotion, but the primary structural issue is the flawed causal link. According to the priority rules, False Cause is last, but since the comparison is a Beta form with a faulty lever, maybe it's a False Cause. Wait, the PTA Beta requires similarity/analogy, but here the comparison is not legitimate. So the lever is a faulty analogy, which would be a False Cause? Or is it a different fallacy? Wait, the key is that the speaker is using Nixon's inaction on Cuba to imply that he's inconsistent in his commitments. This is an ad hominem? No, because it's not attacking Nixon's character but his consistency. Wait, the statement is saying that Nixon's actions on Cuba (not protesting) are similar to his stance on the islands, implying he's not committed. That's a False Cause because it's assuming that because Nixon didn't protest Cuba, he's not committed to the islands. The lever is the comparison between the two situations, which is a faulty analogy. So under PTA, this is a Beta form with a faulty similarity lever. According to the rules, Beta requires similarity/analogy, but if the comparison is not legitimate, it's a False Cause? Or maybe it's a False Cause because it's a causal link between Nixon's actions on Cuba and his stance on the islands. Alternatively, it's a Slippery Slope if there's a chain of reasoning, but the example here is a direct comparison. The main issue is the faulty analogy, which is a False Cause. So the classification would be 3: False Cause.
