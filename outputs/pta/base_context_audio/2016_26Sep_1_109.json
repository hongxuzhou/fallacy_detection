    "analysis": "The statement uses emotionally charged language ('seriously troubled', 'losing our jobs') to evoke fear and urgency, replacing logical reasoning with an appeal to emotion. The lever is the emotional state of fear, not a causal or evaluative connection, violating the PTA constraint that emotions cannot substitute for proper levers in Alpha-form arguments. This aligns with Appeal to Emotion (0) as the primary fallacy.",
