    "analysis": "The statement presents three policy claims (free Iraq as ally, example, and security for Israel) without establishing causal or evaluative levers. The form is Gamma (a is X because b is Y), but the levers are missing proper justification. The emotional language ('powerful example,' 'secure Israel') and lack of causal evidence align with False Cause (3), as the speaker assumes policy outcomes without logical connection.",
