    "analysis": "The statement claims that the Brady Bill's ineffectiveness is evidenced by the continued possession of handguns, implying a causal link between the policy and gun ownership. This violates the False Cause (3) constraint by mistaking correlation (gun ownership remaining unchanged) for causation (the Bill's ineffectiveness). The lever (gun ownership) is improperly used to justify the conclusion (Bill's ineffectiveness) without establishing a valid causal relationship.",
