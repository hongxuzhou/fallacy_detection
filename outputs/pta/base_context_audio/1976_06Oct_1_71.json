    "analysis": "The statement claims Ford's policy will lead to twenty nations developing atomic weapons by 1985/1990, implying a direct causal link between the policy and proliferation. This violates the Alpha-form constraint for FF (Fact-Fact) by assuming causation without proper lever (evidence of direct connection). The prediction lacks intermediate justification, making it a False Cause fallacy. While emotional language is present, the primary structural violation is the unsupported causal claim.",
